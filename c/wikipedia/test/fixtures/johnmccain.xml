'''John Sidney McCain III''' (born August 29, 1936)&lt;!-- DON'T WIKILINK DATE.  SEE NOTE ABOVE. --&gt; is the [[senior senator|senior]] [[United States]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Arizona]] and [[presidential nominee]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].

McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1958. He became a [[naval aviator]], flying [[ground-attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he nearly lost his life in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 USS ''Forrestal'' fire]]. In October 1967 while on a bombing mission over [[Hanoi]], he was shot down, badly injured, and captured by the [[North Vietnam]]ese. He was a [[prisoner of war]] until 1973, experiencing episodes of [[torture]] and refusing an out-of-sequence early [[repatriation]] offer; his war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations.

He retired from the Navy as a [[Captain (United States)#United States Navy, Coast Guard, and uniformed services|captain]] in 1981, moved to Arizona, and entered politics. Elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1986, winning re-election easily in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a &quot;maverick&quot; for having disagreed with his party. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the &quot;[[Keating Five]],&quot; he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the [[McCain-Feingold Act]] in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the [[war in Iraq]] should be fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce Committee]], has opposed [[pork barrel]] spending, and played a key role in [[Gang of 14|alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations]].

McCain lost his bid for the Republican nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] to [[George W. Bush]]. He ran again for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, and gained enough [[delegate]]s to become the party's [[presumptive nominee]] in March 2008. McCain was formally nominated at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] in September 2008, together with his chosen [[running mate]] from [[Alaska]], Governor [[Sarah Palin]].

Gamboa said McCain would rather read a history book than do his math homework. He did just enough to pass the classes he didn't find stimulating. 'He stood low in his class,' Gamboa said. 'But that was by choice, not design.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His family, including his older sister Sandy and younger brother Joe,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt; followed his father to various naval postings in the United States and the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, he attended about 20&amp;nbsp;schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-wmd&quot;/&gt;
