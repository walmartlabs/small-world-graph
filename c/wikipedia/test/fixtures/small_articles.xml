'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] encompassing theories and attitudes which support the elimination of all compulsory [[government]],&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;*[[Errico Malatesta]], &quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1930s/xx/toanarchy.htm Towards Anarchism]&quot;, ''MAN!''.

*&quot;Anarchism&quot;. ''The Shorter [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. 2005. P. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the [[state]]. The term ''anarchism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αναρχω, ''anarcho'', meaning &quot;without [[archon]]s&quot; or &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Online dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; from ἀν (''an'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἄρχή (''arche'', &quot;to rule&quot;) + ισμός (from [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] -ιζειν). It is defined by ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' as &quot;the view that society can and should be organized without a coercive state.&quot;&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;Slevin, Carl. &quot;Anarchism&quot;. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific anarchists may have additional criteria for what constitutes anarchism, and they often disagree with each other on what these criteria are. According to ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', &quot;there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, beyond their rejection of compulsory government, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain [[family resemblance]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;. ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types and traditions of anarchism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, Peter]].

[[Anarchist schools of thought]] differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt; Some anarchists fundamentally oppose all types of [[coercion]], while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution, on the path to [[anarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. &quot;The Anarchist Tradition of Political Thought&quot;.

==Origins==

{{main|History of anarchism}}
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Northcote]], ''[[William Godwin]],'' oil on canvas, 1802, the [[National Portrait Gallery]]. William Godwin is credited as one of the founders of modern anarchism.]]
Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] sages [[Laozi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zhuangzi]]. The latter has been translated, ''&quot;There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success].&quot;'' and ''&quot;A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a State.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf|format=pdf|title=Concepts of the role of intellectuals in social change toward laissez faire|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynic]]s and their contemporary, [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iep|c/cynics.htm|Cynics|Julie Piering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version)&lt;/ref&gt; Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had an entirely positive connotation,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; it first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a term of [[abuse]] used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to damn those who were fomenting disorder.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=March 2008}} in opposition to [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as [[oxymoron]]ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; From this climate [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;/&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Burke0061/Vindication/0339_Bk.html Vindication of Natural Society]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a [[philosophical anarchist]], opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Retrieved 7 December 2006, from [http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable.

The first to describe himself as anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does “what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p.45. &lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0802054587 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as &quot;a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=Selected Writings |publisher=Anchor Books |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |year=1969 | oclc = 221546850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By &quot;commune&quot;, Proudhon meant local [[self-government]] or according to literal translation, &quot;municipality&quot;, rather than a communist arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Samuel. 1984. ''French Political and Intellectual''. History. Transaction Publishers. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}

[[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) was the first self-described anarchist.]]

===Mutualism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labor movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticized [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon's ideas were introduced by [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]],&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his &quot;Bank of the People&quot;]'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[individualist anarchists]] in the United States including [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[William Batchelder Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot;On Picket Duty&quot;, ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881–1908)''; 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to Greene, in the mutualist system each worker would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterized as being ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0–691–04494–5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0–631–17944–5, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterized his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism comprises several traditions&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which hold that &quot;individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, Andrew, ''Key Concepts in Politics'', Palgrave, ISBN 0–312–23381–7, 2000, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately, unlike the social/socialist/collectivist/communitarian wing which advocates common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Freeden, Michael. ''Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 019829414X. pp. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=woodcock20&gt;Woodcock, George. 2004. ''Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements''. Broadview Press. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood. ''The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature'', Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138.&lt;br /&gt;''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', edited by Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]], and [[Murray Rothbard]].

[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]).]]
One of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism was [[Max Stirner]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|max-stirner|Max Stirner|[[David Leopold]]|2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name = &quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;/&gt; [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirner's philosophy]] was an &quot;[[Egoism|egoist]]&quot; form of individualist anarchism according to which the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;, taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. &quot;Anarchism.&quot; 1987. ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought''. Blackwell Publishing. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[reification|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;{{ndash}} he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…&quot; In Ossar, Michael. 1980. ''Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller''. SUNY Press. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner preached self-assertion and foresaw &quot;associations of egoists&quot; where respect for ruthlessness drew people together.&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt;

A less radical form of individualist anarchism was advocated by the &quot;Boston anarchists,&quot;&lt;ref name=encarta7/&gt; American individualists who supported private property exchangeable in a [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market – that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist.&quot; &quot;Anarchism and Property&quot;, by Benjamin Tucker in ''The New Freewoman'', 15 November 1913&lt;/ref&gt; They advocated the protection of liberty and property by private contractors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker]], &quot;defense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices&quot; &quot;Instead of a Book&quot; (1893)&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Anarchism does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders.&quot; Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty'' 19 October 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; and endorsed exchange of labor for wages,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. &quot;[http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html Labor and Its Pay]&quot;, from ''Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin T. Tucker''&lt;/ref&gt;. They did not have a problem that &quot;one man employ another&quot; or that &quot;he direct him,&quot; in his labor but demanded that &quot;all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. &quot;Anarchism in the United States&quot;. ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed [[state monopoly capitalism]] (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly&lt;ref name=schwartzman&gt;Schwartzman, Jack. &quot;Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists&quot;. ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Vol. 62, No. 5 (November, 2003). p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;) prevented labor from being fully rewarded. Even among the nineteenth century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine, as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including [[intellectual property]] rights and [[Possession (law)|possession]] versus [[property]] in land.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander.

===Social anarchism===
{{main|Social anarchism}}
Social anarchism is one of two different broad categories of anarchism, the other category being individualist anarchism. The term social anarchism is often used to identify communitarian forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid. Social anarchism includes anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, Libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, social ecology and sometimes mutualism.

====Collectivist anarchism====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; form of anarchism, commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Johann Most]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is a specific tendency, not to be confused with the broad category sometimes called [[collectivist]] or [[communitarian]] anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Christopher W. 1998. ''An Essay on the Modern State''. Cambridge University Press. p 50. The collectivist ''category'' is also sometimes known as social, socialist, or communitarian anarchism category.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]],&quot; which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;/&gt; However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt; [[James Guillaume|Guillaume, James]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876)&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0521361826 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship{{ndash}} their dictatorship, of course{{ndash}} can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] believed that in [[anarchy]], workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society.]]

====Anarchist communism====
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
Anarchist communists propose that the freest form of social organisation would be a society composed of [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with collective use of the [[means of production]], organized by [[direct democracy]], and related to other communes through [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;[[Isaac Puente|Puente, Isaac]].[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;]. ''The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review''. Issue 6 Orkney 1982 &lt;/ref&gt; However, some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor [[consensus democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Graeber|Graeber, David]] and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''&lt;/ref&gt; In anarchist communism, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[profit]]s or payment), but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0–631–17944–5, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; According to anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] and later [[Murray Bookchin]], the members of such a society would spontaneously perform all necessary labour because they would recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual aid.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Kropotkin, &quot;peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate,&quot; and &quot;a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space... considered necessary for that number of people&quot; and the artisan &quot;working with their own tools or handloom&quot; would not be interfered with,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kropotkin-Act-104-05&quot;&gt;Kropotkin ''Act for yourselves.''

Some [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], such as the Spanish union ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) see an anarcho-communist society as their objective.

Like most schools of anarchism, anarcho-communism has conflicts with other schools. For instance, most individualist anarchists consider it incompatible with [[political freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Yarros|Yarros, Victor S.]] &quot;A Princely Paradox&quot;, ''Liberty'', Vol 4. No. 19, Saturday, 9 April 1887, Whole Number 97; Tucker, Benjamin. &quot;Labor and Its Pay&quot;; Appleton, Henry. &quot;Anarchism, True and False&quot;, ''Liberty'' 2.24, no. 50, 6 September 1884, p. 4; Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''; Rothbard, Murray. &quot;[http://www.mises.org/story/2197 The Death Wish of the Anarcho-Communists]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platformism]] is an anarchist communist tendency in the tradition of [[Nestor Makhno]], who argued for the &quot;vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of anarchist communism are strongly [[Ethical egoism|Egoist]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and are strongly influenced by radical individualist philosophy, believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Anarchist communist [[Emma Goldman]] blended the philosophies of both Max Stirner and Kropotkin in her own.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anarcho-syndicalism====
{{main|Syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[Image:Anarchist flag.svg|right|thumb|A common anarcho-syndicalist flag.]]
In the early 20th century, anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David, ''A History of the French Anarchist Movement'', 1917–1945 p.134&lt;/ref&gt;    With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical [[trade union]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically [[Workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]].

Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles include workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and workplace recuperations), and [[workers' self-management]]. This is compatible with other branches of anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to [[anarchist communism|anarchist communist]] or [[collectivist anarchist]] [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Iain Mckay |title=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |isbn=1902593901 |oclc=182529204|chapter=Are there different types of social anarchism? |url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.

An early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism'' outlined a view of the movement's origin, aims and importance to the future of labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism]'' by [[Rudolf Rocker]], retrieved 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Although more often associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today, united across national borders by membership in the [[International Workers Association]], including the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] (SAC) in [[Sweden]], the ''[[Unione Sindacale Italiana]]'' (USI) in [[Italy]], and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Spain.

===Recent schools of thought===
[[Image:Bey hakim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temporary Autonomous Zone]] theorist [[Peter Lamborn Wilson|Hakim Bey]] is an influential figure in contemporary anarchist circles.]]
Anarchism continues to generate many eclectic and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] philosophies and movements; since the revival of anarchism in the [[U.S.A.|U.S.]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=&quot;revival&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools have emerged. [[Anarcho-capitalism]] developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] as a rejuvenated form of [[individualist anarchism]], while the burgeoning [[feminism|feminist]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movements also produced anarchist offshoots.

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;[[left-wing politics|Left]]&quot; and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements, single issue causes and calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought, and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside the leftist milieu. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought developed by [[Saul Newman]] and associated with thinkers such as [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. It draws from a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], post-left anarchy, [[situationism]], [[postcolonialism]] and [[Zapatismo]].

Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]], which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].

====Anarcho-capitalism====
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism|market anarchism}}
[[Anarcho-capitalism]] (or &quot;[[free market anarchism]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This volume honors the foremost contemporary exponent of market anarchism. One contributor describes Murray Rothbard as 'the most ideologically committed zero-State academic economist on earth'.&quot; Review by Lawrence H. White of &quot;Man, Economy, and Liberty: Essays in honor of Murray N. Rothbard&quot;, published in ''Journal of Economic Literature'', Vol XXVIII, June 1990, page 664&lt;/ref&gt;) is &quot;based on a belief in the freedom to own private [[property]], a rejection of any form of governmental authority or intervention, and the upholding of the competitive free market as the main mechanism for social interaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarcho-capitalism.&quot; ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2004. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the historically [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] nature of most anarchist thought, the status of [[anarchism and anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalism within anarchism]] is disputed, particularly by [[anarchist communism|communist anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;Jainendra, Jha. 2002. &quot;Anarchism&quot;.

''Playboy Magazine'', March 1969&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[state]]. In Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism, law (the non-aggression principle) is enforced by the market but not created by it, while according to [[David D. Friedman]]'s utilitarian version, the law itself is produced by the market.

While the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; was coined by Rothbard and its origin is attributed to 1960s [[United States]], some historians, including Rothbard himself, trace the school as far back as the mid-19th century to market theorists such as [[Gustave de Molinari]].&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Preface. The Production of Security. By Gustave Molinari. 1849, 1977. [http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism has drawn influence from pro-market theorists such as Molinari, [[Frédéric Bastiat]], and [[Robert Nozick]], as well as American individualist thinkers such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon, David.

====Anarcha-feminism====
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
[[Image:Anfem.svg|thumb|A purple and black flag is often used to represent [[Anarcha-feminism]].]]
Anarcha-feminism is a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary [[hierarchy]] – to which anarchists are opposed. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s.

Many [[Anarcha-feminists]] are especially critical of marriage. For instance, Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that &quot;... [woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, &quot;Marriage and Love&quot;, ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminists view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[state]] and [[capitalism]]. [[L. Susan Brown]] expressed the sentiment that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Susan Brown|Brown, Susan]]. &quot;Beyond Feminism: Anarchism and Human Freedom&quot; ''Anarchist Papers 3'' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several male anarcha-feminists, such as the [[Anarcho communism|Anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] who opposed [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]'s [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] views.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchist-Communism'' by Alain Pengam&lt;/ref&gt;

====Green anarchism====
{{main|Green anarchism}}
[[Image:Darker green and Black flag.svg|right|thumb|Green and black flag of Green Anarchism.]]
Green anarchism is an anarchist school of thought which places an emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. Sometimes, green anarchism is said to be techno-positive or techno-negative to differentiate between those who advocate use of advanced green technology to create and maintain an anarchist society and those who mainly see civilization and modern technology as something negative.

[[Anarcho-primitivism]] is a form of green anarchism that believes [[civilization]] and [[technology]] inevitably lead to inequality and are incompatible with anarchism and in effect must be abolished. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize traditional anarchism for supporting civilization and technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation.  They instead advocate the process of [[rewilding]] or reconnecting with the natural environment.

Non-primitivist green anarchists, such as anthropologist [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]], often draw influence from the [[social ecology]] of [[Murray Bookchin]].

===Anarchism without adjectives===
{{main|Anarchism without adjectives}}
&quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot;, in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, &quot;referred to an [[hyphen|unhyphenated]] form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as [[Anarchist communism|communist]], [[collectivism|collectivist]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]], or [[individualist anarchism|individualist]]. For others,…[it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135] &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot; emphasizes harmony among various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs.
The position was first adopted in 1889 by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] as a call for [[toleration]], after being troubled by the &quot;bitter debates&quot; among the different anarchist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltairine de Cleyre]],&lt;ref&gt;Voltairine De Cleyre, &quot;Why I Am an Anarchist&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Errico Malatesta]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Nettlau|Nettlau, Max]]. ''A Short History of Anarchism'' [p. 198–9]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Woodworth]] are noteworthy exponents of the view.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]'', [[Paul Avrich]] (2006). p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a social movement==
{{citations missing|section|date=November 2007}}
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
===The First International===
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the anti-authoritarians in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], wherein ten countries experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist revolutions.  After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789 - 1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his associates joined the First International – which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0–521–36973–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the anti-authoritarian{{POV-statement|date=April 2008}} sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm 'Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1–55164–251–4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organized labor===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchism in Spain}}
[[Image:Woman with cntfai flag.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish anarcho-syndicalists successfully organized [[List of anarchist communities#Spanish revolution .281936 to 1939.29|autonomous communities]] during the [[Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939).]]
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p.100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-resolution'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=4 October 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] |quote=(It is) Resolved ... that eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labor from and after 1 May 1886, and that we recommend to labor organizations throughout this district that they so direct their laws so as to conform to this resolution by the time named. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, unions across America prepared a general strike in support of the event.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-strike'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=4 October 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when replacement workers attempted to cross the picket line. Police intervention led to the deaths of four men, enraging the workers of the city. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |pages=p. 193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J. Degan |accessdate=2008-01-19 |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 27 June 1886, quoted in {{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |pages=p. 209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.&lt;ref name='the bomb'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/dramas/act2/act2.htm |title=Act II: Let Your Tragedy Be Enacted Here |accessdate=2008-01-19 |year=2000 |work=The Dramas of Haymarket |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organizers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labor movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organize for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |pages=p. 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] became an annual event the following year.

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social [[revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformism|reformist]], and could even be, at times, [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.

The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

=== Russian Revolution===
{{main|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin's]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist” Marxist state would become a new elite&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the [[Platformism|Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]],&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda group |authorlink=Dielo Trouda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkism.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others.{{Who|date=April 2008}} Platformist groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

===Fight against fascism===
{{main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Spain}}
[[Image:Members of the Maquis in La Tresorerie.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-fascist [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], who resisted [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] rule in Europe.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution&quot;. ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivized]] the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.

==Internal issues and debates==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
 [[Image:Uroligheder3.jpg|thumb|right|The efficacy and legitimacy of using [[violence]] to political ends [[Anarchism and violence|have been controversial issues amongst anarchists]].]]
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
Anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]] (which anarchists usually reject, according to the ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt;), [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[Issues in anarchism#Definitional concerns|definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].

'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorders|brain development disorder]] that is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old. This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) such as [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS).&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; Other proposed [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as childhood [[vaccine]]s, are [[Controversies in autism|controversial]]; the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; Most recent reviews estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly as a result of changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

Autism affects many parts of the [[Human brain|brain]]; how this occurs is not understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. There is no known cure.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful,&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; and an [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.&lt;ref name=Rajendran/&gt;

==Classification==
Autism is a brain development disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Impairments result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;ref name=Penn/&gt; Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt;

[[Image:Asperger kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Asperger]] introduced the modern sense of the word ''autism'' in 1938.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;]]
Of the other four PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG |title= Autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuron |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=2000 |pages=355–63 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X |pmid=11144346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike autism, Asperger's has no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= [[American Psychiatric Association]] |date=2000 |isbn=0890420254 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.mindsite.com/dsm_iv/asperger_s_disorder#diagnostic_criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger's and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freitag CM |title= The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal= Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''. In this article, ''autism'' refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, ''autism'', ''ASD'', and ''PDD'' are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]] (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as avoiding eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S |title= Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families |journal= Am J Psychiatry |date=1997 |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=185–90 |pmid=9016266 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[mentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Happé F |title= Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure |journal=Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=540–7 |date=1999 |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- and [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref name=hypersystem/&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into [[syndrome|syndromal]] and non-syndromal autism, where the former is associated with severe or profound [[mental retardation]] or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as [[tuberous sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2005 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=103–16 |title= Specific genetic disorders and autism: clinical contribution towards their identification |author= Cohen D, Pichard N, Tordjman S ''et al.'' |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1038-2 |pmid=15796126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals with Asperger's tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the [[Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome#Differences from high-functioning autism|overlap between Asperger's, HFA, and non-syndromal autism]] is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Validity of ASD subtypes:

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills after 14 months of age, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including [[regressive autism]], setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volkmar&gt;{{cite journal |author= Volkmar F, Chawarska K, Klin A |title= Autism in infancy and early childhood |journal= Annu Rev Psychol |date=2005 |volume=56 |pages=315–36 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070159 |pmid=15709938}} A partial update is in: {{cite journal |journal= World Psychiatry |date=2008 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=19–21 |title= Autism in infants: an update |author= Volkmar FR, Chawarska K |pmid=18458791 |pmc=2366821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations has hampered research into causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2008 |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=1225–9 |title= Autism and the environment: challenges and opportunities for research |author= Altevogt BM, Hanson SL, Leshner AI |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3000 |pmid=18519493}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior, with the name ''Type 1 autism'' denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the gene [[contactin associated protein-like 2]] (CNTNAP2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Am J Hum Genet |date=2008 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |title= Unraveling autism |author= Stephan DA |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.003 |pmid=18179879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than one single symptom. The main characteristics are impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathological severity from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the social communication of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales|author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]]|publisher=Knopf|date=1995|isbn=0679437851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impairments become apparent early in childhood and continue through adulthood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and anticipatory postures and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person's hand.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2004|volume=10|issue=4|pages=221–33|title=Early detection of core deficits in autism|author=Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046|pmid=15666338}}&lt;/ref&gt; They display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1123–34|title=Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review|author=Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x|pmid=15257669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.&lt;ref name=Sigman&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327–55 |title= Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author= Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common belief, autistic children do not prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they are.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. Dominick ''et al.'' interviewed the parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title= Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author= Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |date=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title= The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author= Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and the desynchronization of vocal patterns with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title= Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author= Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title= Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author= Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[Image:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made]]
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=RBS-R/&gt; categorizes as follows.
*'''[[Stereotypy]]''' is apparently purposeless movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
*'''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a certain way.
*'''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
*'''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time, such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title= The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author= Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/v03747x60562638m/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program.
*'''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as biting oneself. Dominick ''et al.'' reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=RBS-R&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title= Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author= Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.&lt;ref name=Filipek&gt;{{cite journal |author= Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.'' |title= The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493}} {{cite journal |title=Erratum |quotes=no |date=2000 |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=81 |doi=10.1023/A:1017256313409 |pmid=10638459}} This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious [[Savant syndrome|autistic savant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Treffert DA |title= Savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition—a synopsis: past, present, future |publisher= Wisconsin Medical Society |date=2006 |url=http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/overview_of_savant_syndrome/synopsis |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual responses to [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimuli]] are more common and prominent in autistic children, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2005|volume=46|issue=12|pages=1255–68|title=Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism?

Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include [[poor muscle tone]], [[Apraxia|poor motor planning]], and [[toe walking]]; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Brain Dev |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=565–70 |title= Prevalence of motor impairment in autism spectrum disorders |author= Ming X, Brimacombe M, Wagner GC |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2007.03.002 |pmid=17467940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; this does not appear to result in [[malnutrition]]. Although some children with autism also have [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=713–27|title=Gastrointestinal factors in autistic disorder: a critical review|author=Erickson CA, Stigler KA, Corkins MR, Posey DJ, Fitzgerald JF, McDougle CJ|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0019-4|pmid=16267642}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt;

[[Sleep]] problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities, and there is some evidence that children with ASD are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities; autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal [[Wakefulness|awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Dominick ''et al.'' found that about two-thirds of children with ASD had a history of sleep problems.&lt;ref name=Dominick&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Res Dev Disabil|year=2007|volume=28|issue=2|pages=145–62|title=Atypical behaviors in children with autism and children with a history of language impairment|author=Dominick KC, Davis NO, Lainhart J, Tager-Flusberg H, Folstein S|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2006.02.003|pmid=16581226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2007 |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=e1040–6 |title= Psychological functioning and coping among mothers of children with autism: a population-based study |author= Montes G, Halterman JS |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2819 |pmid=17473077 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/119/5/e1040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=313–20 |title= Siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorders across the life course |author= Orsmond GI, Seltzer MM |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20171 |pmid=17979200 |url=http://waisman.wisc.edu/family/pdf/MRDDRR-OrsmondSeltzer2007.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{main|Causes of autism}}
[[Image:Single Chromosome Mutations.png|thumb|left|Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all [[chromosome abnormalities]] that have been implicated in autism.&lt;ref name=Beaudet/&gt;]]
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare [[mutation]]s with major effects.&lt;ref name=Abrahams&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nat Rev Genet |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=341–55 |title= Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology |author= Abrahams BS, Geschwind DH |doi=10.1038/nrg2346 |pmid=18414403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of twins estimated [[heritability]] explains more than 90% of the risk of autism, assuming a shared environment and no other genetic or medical syndromes.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified.

All known [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |date=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies,&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; extensive searches are underway.&lt;ref name=Szpir&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |date=2006 |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=A412–8 |title= Tracing the origins of autism: a spectrum of new studies |author= Szpir M |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/114-7/focus.html |pmid=16835042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, [[infectious disease]], [[heavy metals]], [[solvent]]s, [[diesel exhaust]], [[PCBs]], [[phthalates]] and [[phenol]]s used in [[plastic]] products, [[pesticide]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[smoking]], [[illicit drug]]s, [[vaccine]]s,&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; and [[prenatal stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |date=2008 |title= Prenatal stress and risk for autism |author= Kinney DK, Munir KM, Crowley DJ, Miller AM |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.004 |pmid=18598714 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1519–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of [[childhood immunizations]] and an increasing likelihood of [[Measles#Public health|measles outbreaks]], there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the [[MMR vaccine controversy|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism]], and there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine preservative [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal helps cause autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccines and autism:

==Mechanism==
Despite extensive investigation, how autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [[pathophysiology]] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [[neuropsychological]] linkages between brain structures and behaviors.&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;{{cite journal |author= Penn HE |title= Neurobiological correlates of autism: a review of recent research |journal= Child Neuropsychol |date=2006 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–79 |doi=10.1080/09297040500253546 |pmid=16484102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Leukoc Biol |date=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |title= The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research |author= Ashwood P, Wills S, Van de Water J |doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707 |pmid=16698940 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[autoantibodies]] have not been associated with pathology, are found in diseases other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |year=2007 |volume=1107 |pages=79–91 |title= Autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) |author= Wills S, Cabanlit M, Bennett J, Ashwood P, Amaral D, Van de Water J |doi=10.1196/annals.1381.009 |pmid=17804535}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol |date=2008 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=4–11 |title= The neuropathology of autism: where do we stand? |author= Schmitz C, Rezaie P |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00872.x |pmid=17971078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[neurotransmitter]] abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of [[serotonin]].

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the [[default mode network]], a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the [[task-positive network]], used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. The two networks are not negatively correlated in people with autism, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Broyd SJ, Demanuele C, Debener S, Helps SK, James CJ, Sonuga-Barke EJS |title= Default-mode brain dysfunction in mental disorders: a systematic review |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |year=2008 |pmid=18824195 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the [[cingulate cortex]] which differs in individuals with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neuron |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=463–73 |title= Self responses along cingulate cortex reveal quantitative neural phenotype for high-functioning autism |author= Chiu PH, Kayali MA, Kishida KT ''et al.'' |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.12.020 |pmid=18255038 |laysummary=http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/20167/ |laysource= Technol Rev |laydate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events—but are less effective at [[Empathy|empathizing]] by handling events generated by other agents.&lt;ref name=hypersystem&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen S]]|title=The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism|journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=865–72|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010|pmid=16519981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends the extreme male brain theory, which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom [[EQ SQ theory|systemizing is better than empathizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baron-Cohen S|title=The extreme male brain theory of autism|journal=Trends Cogn Sci|date=2002|volume=6|issue=6|pages=248–54|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6|pmid=12039606}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is related to the earlier [[theory of mind]], which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally-Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Leslie AM, Frith U|title=Does the autistic child have a 'theory of mind'? |journal=Cognition |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |year=1985 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 |pmid=2934210 |url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf |format = PDF | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. [[Executive dysfunction]] hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]], and other forms of executive function.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title= Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal= Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hill EL |title= Executive dysfunction in autism |journal= Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weakness is that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt; [[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Frith U |title= The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 |pmid=16450045}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |title= Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author= Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=HappeTime&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Ronald A, [[Robert Plomin|Plomin R]] |title= Time to give up on a single explanation for autism |journal= Nat Neurosci |date=2006 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=1218–20 |doi=10.1038/nn1770 |pmid=17001340}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref name=Rajendran&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224–60 |title= Cognitive theories of autism |author= Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:

*No [[gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.
*No single words by 16 months.
*No two-word spontaneous phrases (other than instances of [[echolalia]]) by 24 months.
*Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349–53 |title= Autistic regression and Landau-Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |author= Mantovani JF |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2000.tb00104.x |pmid=10855658 |doi_brokendate= 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nat Clin Pract Neurol |date=2008 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title= Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author= Landa RJ |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dis Child |date=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title= How to diagnose autism |author= Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 U.S. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was 48 months and of formal ASD diagnosis was 61 months, reflecting an average 13-month delay, all far above recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |date=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S79–87 |title= Examination of the time between first evaluation and first autism spectrum diagnosis in a population-based sample |author= Wiggins LD, Baio J, Rice C |pmid=16685189 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Genet Med |date=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title= Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author= Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource= Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the U.S. and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ledbetter DH |title= Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2008 |pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMe0806570}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129–35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143|pmid=17563895}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research|author=Cass H|journal=Autism|date=1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are occasionally missed. Adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= National Autistic Society |title= Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult? |date=2005 |url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018 |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US-autism-6-11-1996-2005.png|thumb|left|Reports of autism cases grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's [[prevalence]].]]
Most recent [[review]]s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer&gt;{{cite journal |author= Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |title= The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal= Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.&lt;ref name=Caronna&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dis Child |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=518–23 |title= Autism spectrum disorders: clinical and research frontiers |author= Caronna EB, Milunsky JM, Tager-Flusberg H |doi=10.1136/adc.2006.115337 |pmid=18305076}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PDD-NOS]] cases are the vast majority of ASD, [[Asperger's]] prevalence is about 0.3 per 1,000, and the remaining ASD forms are much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Clin Psychiatry |date=2005 |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 10 |pages=3–8 |title= Epidemiology of autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders |author= [[Eric Fombonne|Fombonne E]] |pmid=16401144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,&lt;ref&gt;Changes in diagnostic practices:
*{{cite journal|author=Fombonne E|title=The prevalence of autism|journal=JAMA|date=2003|volume=289|issue=1|pages=87–9|pmid=12503982|doi=10.1001/jama.289.1.87}}

The risk of autism is associated with several prenatal and [[perinatal]] risk factors. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America, and also found associated [[obstetric]] conditions that included low [[birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kolevzon A, Gross R, Reichenberg A |title= Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=161 |issue=4 |date=2007 |pages=326–33 |pmid=17404128 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/161/4/326 |doi= 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism is associated with several other conditions:
*'''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B |title= Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder |journal= Nat Rev Genet |date=2001 |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=943–55 |doi=10.1038/35103559 |pmid=11733747}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Brain Dev |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–72 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author= Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mental retardation]]'''. The fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Learning in autism |author= Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher= Academic Press |date=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=0-12-370504-5 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ASD other than autism, the association with mental retardation is much weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E |title= Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children |journal=JAMA |date=2001 |volume=285 |issue=24 |pages=3093–9 |pmid=11427137 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 |doi= 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Maleness]]'''. Boys are at higher risk for autism than girls. The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;
*'''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Epilepsia |date=2007 |volume=48 |issue= Suppl 9 |pages=33–5 |title= The autism-epilepsy connection |author= Levisohn PM |pmid=18047599}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=Manzi&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Child Neurol |date=2008 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=307–14 |title= Autism and metabolic diseases |author= Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P |doi=10.1177/0883073807308698 |pmid=18079313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[ADHD]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Eur J Pediatr |date=2008 |title= What's new in autism? |author= Steyaert JG, De La Marche W |doi=10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 |pmid=18597114 |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=1091–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{See also|Sociological and cultural aspects of autism}}

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[table talk (literature)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]] contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Autism|volume=1|issue=1|pages=13–23|date=1997|doi=10.1177/1362361397011004|title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality|author=[[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luther's notetaker [[Johannes Mathesius|Mathesius]], Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh [[demonic possession|possessed by the devil]], and suggested that he be suffocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles M|date=2005|title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say?|publisher=Independent Living Institute|url=http://independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html|accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=201–8|title=The history of autism|author=Wolff S|doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5|pmid=15365889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''autos'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH|title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology|journal=Hist Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=3|date=2004|pages=361–6|doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603|pmid=15386868}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:kanner kl2.jpg|thumb|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology &quot;autistic psychopaths&quot; in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |title= Das psychisch abnormale Kind |author= [[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating a form of ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |date=1943}} {{cite journal |title=Reprint |quotes=no |date=1968 |journal= Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title= Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/m55051670u35066p/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like &quot;infantile schizophrenia&quot;, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Can J Psychiatry |date=2003 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=503–5 |title= Modern views of autism |author= Fombonne E |pmid=14574825 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author= [[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition = 2nd ed |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0521549574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism |author= Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 |pmid=18297387 |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1320–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=323–30 |title= A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting |author= Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x |pmid=16119473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet]] has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Biever C |title= Web removes social barriers for those with autism |work= New Scientist |issue=2610 |date=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.&lt;ref name=Rajendran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Harmon A |title= How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=2004-12-20 |work= New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''albedo''' of an object is the extent to which it diffusely reflects light from the sun.  It is therefore a more specific form of the term [[reflectivity]].  Albedo is defined as
the ratio of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] to incident [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is a [[Dimensionless number|unitless]] measure indicative of a surface's or body's diffuse [[reflectivity]]. The word is derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot;, in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;. The range of possible values is from 0 (dark) to 1 (bright).

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. In climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage. Its value depends on the [[frequency]] of radiation considered: unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation. Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions in a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution. In realistic cases, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) is required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although albedos are a very useful first approximation.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 90% for fresh snow, to about 4% for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[Black body|blackbody]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=P. R. |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2001 |month= |title=Earthshine Observations of the Earth’s Reflectance |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1671–1674 |id= |url=http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2001/2000GL012580.shtml |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.1029/2000GL012580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds. 

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments onboard the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar \bar \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedo of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s. 

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 86%. Many objects in the outer solar system and [[asteroid belt]] have low albedos down to about 5%.&lt;ref name=astalbedo&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily [[space weathering|space weathered]] surface containing some [[organic compound]]s. 

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 7%, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm A discussion of Lunar albedos&lt;/ref&gt; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless solar system bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is&lt;ref name=bruton&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is diameter in kilometres, and ''H'' is the absolute magnitude.

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single scattering albedo]] - is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle(s), and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

==Some examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===The tropics===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases up to 3 °C (5.4 °F) year-round,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, R. E., and P. J. Kennedy, 1992: ''Impacts on regional climate of Amazon deforestation''. Geophys. Res. Lett., '''19''', 1947–1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html]  Project Amazonia: Characterization - Abiotic - Water&lt;/ref&gt; although part of the effect is due to changed evaporation ([[latent heat]] flux).

===Small scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear lighter color clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html Health and Safety: Be Cool! (8/97)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling. [[Cloud feedback]]s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/Resources/gcc/1-3-3.html | title=The Climate System | publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University | accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between deciduous and coniferous is because coniferous trees are darker in general and have cone-shaped crowns. The shape of these crowns trap radiant energy more effectively than deciduous trees.  

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref&gt;Betts, R.A. (2000) ''Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo'', Nature, Volume 408, Issue 6809, pp. 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 90%; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). 

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[Image:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity (from as high as 100%) because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref&gt;http://lenah.freeshell.org/pp/01-ONW-St.Petersburg/Fresnel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at high and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at small angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at low angles of incident light. 

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up (not smooth at the scale of the wavelength of light) so the Fresnel equations do not apply. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
{{see|Cloud albedo}}

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields by [[Saddam Hussein]] showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCNs]] and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR (IPCC)|SAR]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m...&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--When inserting apostrophes in this section, be careful--&gt;
The letter '''A''' is the first letter in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] is '''a'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;a&quot;, ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged,'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; ({{pronEng|eɪ}}), plural ''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, ''A''s, ''a''s, or ''a's''.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors'' p. 61 (1998); ''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 15th ed. (University of Chicago Press, 2003) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The letter A can be traced to a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] or the [[Proto-semitic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Circa 1600 B.C. the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign for the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and kept its name with a minor change ([[alpha (letter)|alpha]]). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

The letter has two [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]], and in [[italic type]], consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|ɑ}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{IPA|a}}). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

== Usage ==
[[Image:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story and single-story '''a'''.]]
In [[English language|English]], the letter &quot;A&quot; by itself usually denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} (though the pronunciation varies with the dialect) as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]].

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑ/}}), or an [[open central unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/a/}}). In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of the letter A denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital A denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase a denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

''A'' is the third-most common letter in English, and the second-most common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. On average, about 8.2% of letters in English tend to be ''A''s, while the number is 6.2% in Spanish and 4% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/resources/LetFreq.html|title=Percentages of Letter frequencies per Thousand words|accessdate=2006-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Codes for computing ==
{{Letter
|NATO=Alpha
|Morse=·–

}}
In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] A is codepoint U+0041 and the [[Lower case|lowercase]] a is U+0061.

In [[Positional notation|positional numeral systems]] with base higher than 10, A is the character used to represent decimal 10, or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], 1010

The [[ASCII]] code for capital A is 65 and for lowercase a is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital A is 193 and for lowercase a is 129.

The [[morse code]] for A is   dit dah  or  a dot and a dash.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

'''Alabama''' (formally, the '''State of Alabama'''; {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Alabama.ogg|/ˌæləˈbæmə/}}) is a [[state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southern region]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with almost 4.6&amp;nbsp;million residents in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html census.gov |title=Alabama Quick Facts |accessdate=2007-09-08 |work=State and County Quick Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many Southern States, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. White rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests were underrepresented.&lt;ref name = &quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;[http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed March 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following [[World War II]], Alabama experienced significant recovery as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and high technology, as well as the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Air Force]]. Today, the state is heavily invested in aerospace, education, health care, and banking, and various heavy industries including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication.

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker#Alabama|Yellowhammer]] State'', which is also the name of the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]]&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and the largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. The largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].

==Etymology of state name==
The [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]], a [[Muskogean]] tribe, which resided just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River]]s on the upper reaches of the [[Alabama River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0231-X |oclc=10724679 |ISBN status=May be invalid - please double check}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the [[etymology|etymological source]] of the names of the river and state.

Alabama was the new frontier in the 1820s and 1830s. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of fertile soils. Planters brought slaves with them, and traders brought in more from the Upper South as the cotton plantations expanded. The economy of the central &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]&quot; featured large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on the labor of enslaved African Americans. It was named for the dark, fertile soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Elsewhere poor whites were subsistence farmers. According to the 1860 census, enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 free persons of color. 

In 1861 Alabama seceded from the Union to join the [[Confederate States of America]]. While not many battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War. All the slaves were freed by 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistDocs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|work=Historical Documents
|publisher=HistoricalDocuments.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Alabama was readmitted to the Union in 1868.

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly rural and tied to cotton. Planters resisted working with free labor and sought to re-establish controls over African Americans. Whites used paramilitary groups, [[Jim Crow laws]] and segregation to reduce freedoms of African Americans and restore their own dominance.

In its new constitution of 1901, the elite-dominated legislature effectively disfranchised African Americans through voting restrictions. While the planter class had engaged poor whites in supporting these efforts, the new restrictions resulted in disfranchising poor whites as well. By 1941 a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. This was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name = &quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the African-American community was more pervasive, as nearly all its citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900 fourteen Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900 Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903 only 2,980 had managed to &quot;qualify&quot; to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate. The shut out was long-lasting.&lt;ref name = &quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;  The disfranchisement was ended only by African Americans' leading the Civil Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights. Such legislation also protected the rights of poor whites.

The rural-dominated legislature continued to underfund schools and services for African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web

They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The rate of population growth rate in Alabama (see table) dropped by nearly half from 1910-1920, reflecting the outmigration. 

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed &quot;The Magic City.&quot; By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside of Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state. It received back only 1/67th of the tax money, as the state legislature ensured that taxes were distributed equally to each county regardless of population. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

Because of the long disfranchisement of African Americans, the state continued as one-party Democratic for decades. It produced a number of national leaders. Industrial development related to the demands of [[World War II]] brought prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor [[George Wallace]], many whites in the state opposed integration efforts.

By the moral crusade of the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a restoration of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=cra64&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ''[[De jure]]'' segregation ended in the states as [[Jim Crow laws]] were invalidated or repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the state legislature House and Senate. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population was implemented. This benefited the many urban areas that had developed, and all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name = &quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have also voted increasingly Republican in state elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Climate===
The [[climate]] of Alabama is described as [[temperate]] with an average annual temperature of 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name = &quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama ''&quot;Alabama Climate&quot;'', Encyclopedia Britannica, Retrieved May 7, 2007] &lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name = &quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt; 

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. 

[[Image:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the [[North Alabama]] region. This is shown in this picture taken at the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]] during early January.]]

South Alabama reports more [[thunderstorms]] than any part of the U.S. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80&amp;nbsp;days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]] – the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990-2003, [http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html ]  Retrieved May 8, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[tornado]]es occur – these are common throughout the state, although the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama shares the dubious distinction, with [[Kansas]], of having reported more [[Fujita scale|F5 tornadoes]] than any other state – according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950 to October 31, 2006. An F5 tornado is the most powerful of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;Tornadoproject.com, [http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Retrieved September 3, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; Several long – tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state except for [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]]. The [[Super Outbreak]] of March, 1974, badly affected Alabama. The northern part of the state – along the Tennessee Valley – is one of the areas in the US most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season (November and December) in addition to the Spring severe weather season.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Snow is a rare event in much of Alabama. Areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 77,418 people (that is 319,544 births minus 242,126 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 36,457 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 25,936 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 10,521 people.

The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000).

The [[center of population]] of Alabama is located in [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], outside of the town of [[Jemison, Alabama|Jemison]], an area known as Jemison Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt | url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ancestry===
The racial makeup of the state and comparison to the prior census:
{{US Demographics}}
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama: African American (26.0%), American (17.0%), [[English American|English]] (7.8%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (7.7%), [[German American|German]] (5.7%), and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] (2.0%). 'American' does not include those reported as Native American.

===Religion=== 
Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]]. In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a &quot;full understanding&quot; of their faith and needed no further learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kirsten |last=Campbell |work=Mobile Register |title=Alabama rates well in biblical literacy |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |page=A1 |publisher=Advance Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myaea.org/PDFfile/Confidence%20in%20State%20Institutions07.pdf |title=Confidence in State and Local Institutions Survey |work=Capital Survey Research Center |accessdate 2007-006-02 |type=PDF |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=White |title=Poll says we feel good about state Trust in government, unlike some institutions, hasn't fallen |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |work=Birmingham News |publisher=Birmingham News |page=13A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mobile area is notable for its large percentage of Catholics, owing to the area's unique early history under French and Spanish rule. Today, a huge percentage of Alabamians identify themselves as Protestants. The top two largest denominations in the state are the Baptists (40%), Methodists (10%).

The single largest increase came in the area of durable goods manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/gsp_newsrelease.htm |title=Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by State, 2006 |accessdate=2007-10-16 |format=HTML |work=Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Accounts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, [[per capita income]] for the state was $18,189.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=HTML |work=State and County Quick Facts }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[cereal|grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorghum]], [[vegetable]]s, [[milk]], [[soybean]]s, and [[peach]]es. Although known as &quot;The Cotton State&quot;, Alabama ranks between eight and ten in national cotton production, according to various reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Alabama's [[Industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products; [[mining]] (mostly coal); [[plastic]] products; cars and trucks; and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronics|electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, which is home of the [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Alabama is also home to the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation, including the surrounding states of Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida, and Georgia. Most of this growth is due to Alabama's rapidly expanding automotive manufacturing industry. In Alabama alone since 1993, it has generated more than 67,800 new jobs. Alabama currently ranks 2nd in the nation behind Detroit in automobile output. With recent expansions at sites in Alabama, by early 2009 the state will surpass Detroit and become the largest builder of automobiles in North America.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Birmingham's economy was transformed by investments in bio-technology and medical research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospital. The UAB Hospital is a Level I trauma center providing health care and breakthrough medical research. UAB is now the area's largest employer and the largest in Alabama with a workforce of about 20,000. Health care services provider HealthSouth is also headquartered in the city.

Birmingham is also a leading banking center, serving as home to two major banks: Regions Financial Corporation and Compass Bancshares. SouthTrust, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004. The city still has major operations as one of the regional headquarters of Wachovia. In November 2006, Regions Financial merged with AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. They formed the 8th Largest U. S. Bank (by total assets). Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Magic City, such as Superior Bank and New South Federal Savings Bank.

Telecommunications provider AT&amp;T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence with several large offices in the metropolitan area. Major insurance providers: Protective Life, Infinity Property &amp; Casualty and ProAssurance among others, are headquartered in Birmingham and employ a large number of people in Greater Birmingham. The city is also a powerhouse of construction and engineering companies, including BE&amp;K and B. L. Harbert International which routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design and international construction firms.

The city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].  The [[Port of Mobile]] is the 10th largest by tonnage in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ports1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports in 2006&quot;|work=&quot;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Waterborne Commerce Statistics&quot;|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton06.htm|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, a site north of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] was selected by German steelmaker [[ThyssenKrupp]] for a $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion steel production plant, with the promise of 2,700 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''ThyssenKrupp's Alabama incentive package tops $811&amp;nbsp;million''|publisher=Press register|date=2007-05-11|url=http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/business-2/1178924126194090.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxes==
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5% personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes, July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 9% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 5%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 14% tax on a meal. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. As a result, Alabama's tax structure is one the most regressive in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zengerle  | first = Jason  | title =  2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Biblical Taxation | publisher = New York Times | date = December 14, 2003 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E3DB1E3DF937A25751C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=biblical%20taxation&amp;st=cse | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970-2007) |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million. It is one of only a few handful of states to accomplish large surpluses, with a budget surplus of nearly $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007, and estimated at more than $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion for 2008. The declining national economy has eliminated that surplus and the state is again facing shortfalls.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

==Transportation==
[[Image:Alabama.JPG|thumb|right|Alabama state welcome sign]]

Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross it: [[I-65]] runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where [[I-59]] continues to the north-east corner of the state and [[I-20]] continues east towards Atlanta; [[I-85]] originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, [[I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed around 2012 it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Several US Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]], [[U.S. Route 29|US 29]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 43|US 43]], [[U.S. Route 72|US 72]], [[U.S. Route 78|US 78]], [[U.S. Route 80|US 80]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 98|US 98]], [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]], and [[U.S. Route 280|US 280]].

Major airports in Alabama include [[Birmingham International Airport (US)|Birmingham International Airport]] (BHM), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL), [[Tuscaloosa Regional Airport]] (TCL), and [[Pryor Field Regional Airport]] (DCU). For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.

==Law and government==
[[Image:Alabama state capitol, Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The State Capitol, built in 1850]]
===State government===
{{main|Government of Alabama}}
The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2006-09-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitutionalreform.org Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. 

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[Alabama State Auditor]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]].

===Local and county government===
Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.
*[[List of Alabama county seats]]

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves &quot;dry&quot;; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

===State politics===
[[Image:Bob Riley greeting soldiers in Birmingham, 19 Jan, 2004.jpg|thumb|Alabama Governor Bob Riley]]

The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is [[Jim Folsom Jr]]. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] currently holds a large majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. Due to the Legislature's power to override a gubernatorial [[veto]] by a mere simple majority (most state Legislatures require a 2/3 majority to override a veto), the relationship between the executive and legislative branches can be easily strained when different parties control the branches.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote through intimidation and terrorism. White supremacy was re-established.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 to the 1960s, the state legislature failed to perform redistricting as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972. 

With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. 

In the 1986 Democratic primary election, the then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor lost the Democratic nomination for Governor. The state Democratic party invalidated the election and placed the Lieutenant Governor's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of the candidate chosen in the primary. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger [[Guy Hunt]] as Governor. This was the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction. Since then, Republicans have been increasingly elected to state offices until in 2006 Democrats were barely holding a majority in the state legislature. Since 1986, only one Democrat, [[Don Siegelman]], has managed to win the Governor's office. A corruption probe and eventual trial, the timing of which coincided with the 2006 state primary, relegated Siegelman to one term. 

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. [[George Wallace]], the state's governor, remains a notorious and controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=cra64/&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and the Governor signed, a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date-2007-06-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. 1960 was a curious election. The Democrats won with [[John F. Kennedy]] on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to [[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] carried the state, in part because of his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which restored the franchise for African Americans.

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|the 1968 presidential election]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] over both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Democratic candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and comprise a longstanding majority in the [[Alabama Legislature]].

In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The eleven counties that voted Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are the majority racial group. 

The state's two [[U.S. Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans. 

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, five of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Terry Everett]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and two are Democrats: ([[Bud Cramer]] and [[Artur Davis]]).

==Health and education==
===Primary and secondary education===
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006-2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot; /&gt;

In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law. In 2004, only 23 percent of schools met AYP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AYP&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Leon Benouville The Wrath of Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Wrath of Achilles'', by [[François-Léon Benouville]] (1821&amp;ndash;1859) ([[Musée Fabre]])]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' (also '''Akhilleus''' or '''Achilleus'''; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|Ἀχιλλεύς}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[hero]] of the [[Trojan War]], the [[central character]] and the greatest warrior of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', which takes for its theme the ''Wrath of Achilles''.

Achilles also has the attributes of being the most handsome of the heroes assembled against Troy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]],'' [[Symposium (Plato)#Phaedrus|180a]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the quickest.

Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the first century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel.  These legends state that Achilles was killed in battle by an arrow to the heel, and so an &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a person's principal weakness. 

==Birth==
Achilles was the son of the [[nymph]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fire-bringer, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755-768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34-37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26-47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis's chaste resistance to the advances of [[Zeus]], that Thetis had been so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.&lt;!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:&quot;Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.&quot;--&gt;

[[Image:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (ca. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]
According to the incomplete poem ''Achilleis'' written by [[Statius]] in the first century AD, and to no other sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body she held him by, his heel. (See [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]].) It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-479.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.  To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood.&quot;

Also in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, [[Cypria|Kùpria]] (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad|Ilias Mikrà]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pèrsis by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase-paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. 

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87-89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achilles in the Trojan War== 
[[Image:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]

The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{Polytonic|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}

:Sing Goddess of the rage, of Peleus' son Achilles
:the accursed rage that brought pain to thousands of the Achaeans.

Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (''menis''). His anger is at some times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative. 

===Telephus===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived to [[Argos]], where Achilles heals him in order that he become their guide for the voyage to Troy. 
		
According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. This is an example of [[sympathetic magic]].

===Cycnus of Colonae===
According to the [[Cypria]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 Proclus' Summary of the Cypria]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Epic Cycle]] and traditions related by [[Plutarch]] and the Byzantine scholar [[John Tzetzes]], once the Greek ships arrived in Troy, Achilles fought and killed [[Cycnus|Cycnus of Colonae]], a son of Poseidon. Cycnus was invulnerable, except for his head.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Greek Questions'' 28; Tzetzes, ''On Lycophron''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troilus===
According to the [[Cypria]] (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 Proclus' Summary of the Cypria]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html Dares' account of the destruction of Troy, Greek Mythology Link.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, [[Troilus]] was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King [[Priam]]'s (or sometimes [[Apollo]]) and [[Hecuba]]'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed and decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo by Achilles.  In this version of the myth, Achilles' death came in retribution for a sacrilege he had previously committed, his decapitation of [[Troilus]] upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot; in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html] accessed October 23rd, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles would late die in retribution for this sacrilegious act. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed Troy would have been invincible.

===In the ''Iliad''===
[[Image:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th century illuminated manuscript.]]
{{main|Iliad}}

[[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the [[Trojan War]]. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begged Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.

As the battle turned against the Greeks, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles refused and urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

Eventually, however, hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis, asking her to plead with Zeus to allow the Trojans to push back the Greek forces.
 
The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus led the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

=== Achilles versus Hector ===
[[Image:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|250px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]]. (From a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion)]]]]
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his friend and held many funeral games in his honor.  His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by [[Hector]]. The new armor included the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail by the poet.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Triumphant Achilles in Achilleion cc.jpg|thumb|250px|This is a color-corrected version of the original image above.]] --&gt;
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.  The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.  Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew his death was inevitable and accepted his fate. Hector, wanting to go down fighting, charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword.  Achilles got his vengeance, killing Hector with a single blow to the neck.  He then tied Hector's body to his [[chariot]] and dragged it around the battlefield for nine days.

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, Priam, went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites.  The final passage in the ''Iliad'' is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.

====Penthesilea====
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]].

====Memnon, and the death of Achilles====
[[Image:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Corfu#Beauty, Power and Tragedy: The Achilleion|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles's closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]].  When [[Memnon]] of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] killed Antilochus, Achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. 

As predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]&amp;mdash;either by an arrow (to the heel according to [[Statius]]), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting [[Polyxena]], a princess of Troy.  In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow.
[[Image:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BCE, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich]]
Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented  in the lost Trojan War epic of [[Arctinus of Miletus]] as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]] (see below). 

Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

====The fate of Achilles' armor====
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus. Odysseus won. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.  Athena temporarily made Ajax mad with grief and anguish as he began killing sheep, thinking they were his comrades.  After a while, Athena had lifted the madness and Ajax had seen that he had actually been killing sheep.  In his embarrassment, he then committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

==Achilles and Patroclus==
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}
Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth.  Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the ''[[Iliad]]'', they appeared to be generally portrayed as a model of deep and loyal friendship.  However, commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in 5th century BC Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as pederastic. Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual &quot;war buddies&quot; or as an egalitarian homosexual couple.

==The cult of Achilles in antiquity==
There was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Hedreen, &quot;The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine&quot; ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lost epic ''[[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]],  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.

[[Pliny's Natural History]] (IV.27.1) mentions a [[tumulus]] that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue” (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (''De situ orbis'', II, 7). And the Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor” (''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913).

The ''[[Periplus|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships”. (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic (Black) Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even thought he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

===The cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu===
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] [[Greece]], Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Corfu#Beauty, Power and Tragedy: The Achilleion|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].

==The name of Achilles==
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{Polytonic|λαός}} (''Laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers''. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks early after 7th century BC&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search_main.html Epigraphical database] gives 164 matches for Ἀχιλλεύς and 368 for Ἀχιλλε.The earliest ones: Corinth 7th c. BC,Delphi 530 BC,Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt;.It was also turned into the female form of Ἀχιλλεία,firstly attested in Attica,4th century BC, (IG II² 1617) and [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|Achillia]], [[:Image:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|a relief from Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting, 'Amazonia'.  Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea, but give it an extra twist of Achilles being 'played' by a woman.

==Other stories about Achilles==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=March 2008}}
[[Image:Achilles in Corfu.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]] 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamea|Deidamia]], whom in the account of [[Statius]] he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', there is a passage in which Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]], the location of the mythical &quot;White Island&quot; which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epiran princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy.

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades — as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]]. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].

==Achilles in Greek tragedy==
{{main|Achilles (play)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the [[Trojan War]], including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles''. Only a few fragments survive.

==Achilles in Greek philosophy==
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;swift-footed&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], in which he proved that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible.  As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

Lee surrendered the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected to the Presidency, Lincoln was a [[lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2005|p= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holzer|2004|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in 1860 and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president]] later that year. During his time in office, he contributed to the effort to preserve the [[United States]] by leading the defeat of the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] [[Confederate States of America]] in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of [[slavery]], issuing his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoting the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln's death and was ratified by the states later in 1865.

Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top [[Military rank|generals]], including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a [[Trent Affair|war scare]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland| United Kingdom]] in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].

Opponents of the war (also known as &quot;[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his [[Gettysburg Address]] is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|His assassination in 1865]] was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a [[martyr]] for the ideal of national unity.

==Early life==
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln's early life and career}}
===Childhood and education===
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Hanks]], two uneducated farmers, in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the {{convert|348|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]), making him the first president born outside the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Lincoln's ancestor [[Samuel Lincoln]] had arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] in the 17th century, but his descendants had gradually moved west, from Pennsylvania to Virginia and then westward to the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Town of Hingham, Massachusetts|author=Tracy Bouvé, Thomas|year=1893|publisher=[[Harvard University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Abe-Lincoln-Birthplace-2.jpg|thumb|Symbolic log cabin at the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]]]]
For some time, Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father, was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a [[Hard-shell Baptists|Hardshell Baptist]] church, although Abraham himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.

In 1816, the Lincoln family was forced to make a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]] (now in [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]), Indiana. He later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery,&quot; and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the [[Northwest Territory]], Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property.

When Lincoln was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of [[milk sickness]]. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]]. Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call &quot;Mother&quot; for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp= 28, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/sites/decaturock.htm|title=Lincoln Trail Homestead State Park|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Don|title=Speeches and Writings 1859-1865|publisher=Library of America|year=1989|pages=p.163|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UWJStTs8-A4C&amp;dq=lincoln+canoe+sangamon+river&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via flatboat on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers.

Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.lincolnportrait.com/physical_man.asp|title=Abraham Lincoln, The Physical Man |publisher=Lincoln Portrait}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandburg|1974|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6&amp;nbsp;foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches (1.93&amp;nbsp;m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.

===Early political career and military service===
[[Image:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of a younger Abraham Lincoln]]
Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]]. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.

He was elected captain of an Illinois [[militia]] company drawn from New Salem during the [[Black Hawk War]], and later wrote that he had not had &quot;any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1946|p= 551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and, after coming across the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', began to teach himself law. [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], that same year and began to practice law with [[John T. Stuart]]. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=John|title=Lincoln as a Lawyer|publisher=Americana House|year=1991|isbn=0962529028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;cc=lincoln;type=simple;rgn=div1;q1=founded%20on%20both%20injustice%20and%20bad%20policy;view=text;subview=detail;sort=occur;idno=lincoln1;node=lincoln1%3A101|title=Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery|publisher=[[University of Michigan Library]]|date=1937-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in this same year that Lincoln met [[Joshua Fry Speed]], who would become a close friend.

Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the ''[[The State Journal-Register|Sangamon Journal]]'', mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat [[James Shields]]. Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in ''Herndon's Lincoln''.

===Marriage and family===
On November 4, 1842 Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in Springfield, Illinois on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].

The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in Springfield. [[William Wallace Lincoln|William &quot;Willie&quot; Wallace Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term. [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]] was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in [[Chicago]].
[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype by N.H. Shepherd, about 1846.]]

===Legislative activity===
A Whig and an admirer of party leader [[Henry Clay]], Lincoln was [[United States House elections, 1846|elected]] to a term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. However, he spoke out against the [[Mexican-American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] desire for &quot;military glory&quot; and challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered [[Spot Resolutions]], demanding to know on what &quot;spot&quot; on US soil that blood was first spilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=020/llcg020.db&amp;recNum=102|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, &quot;God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.&quot; Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered.

Warned by his law partner, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. His statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote [[Oregon Territory]], primarily the [[List of Governors of Oregon|governorship]]. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice.

===Prairie lawyer===
By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of [[Barge|river barges]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]]. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil case which won Lincoln fame as a lawyer was the landmark [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company]]. America's expansion west, which Lincoln strongly supported, was seen as an economic threat to the river trade, which ran north-to-south, primarily on the [[Mississippi river]]. In 1856 a steamboat collided with a bridge, built by the [[Rock Island Railroad]], between [[Rock Island, Illinois]], and [[Davenport, Iowa]], the first railroad bridge to span the Mississippi. The steamboat owner sued for damages, claiming the bridge was a hazard to navigation. Lincoln argued in court for the railroad and won, removing a costly impediment to western expansion by establishing the right of land routes to bridge waterways.
[[Image:Piatt and DeWitt County Lincoln marker wide.jpg|thumb|In the 1920s, historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eighth judicial district. This example is on the border of [[Piatt County, Illinois|Piatt]] and [[DeWitt County, Illinois|DeWitt counties]].]]

Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who had been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]] — a rare tactic at that time — to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' to show that the [[moon]] on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times.

==Republican politics 1854&amp;ndash;1860==
Lincoln returned to politics in response to the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas&amp;ndash;Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 16, 1854, &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=11&amp;subjectID=2|title=Speech at Peoria, October 16,|publisher=Abraham Lincoln and Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln first stood out among the other [[Free Soil Party|free soil]] orators of the day:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.lincolnatpeoria.com/|title=Lincoln at Peoria|publisher=Abraham Lincoln at Peoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The Act has a] ''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world — enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites — causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty — criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but ''self-interest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat [[Lyman Trumbull]]. At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.

In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]]. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: &quot;'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/HouseDivided.html|title=A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand|publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]]|month=June |year=1858|author=Lincoln, Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.

===Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858===
{{main|Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858}}
The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[republicanism]], while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of [[democracy]], as set forth in his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more [[popular vote]]s, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star.
==1860 Presidential Election==

{{main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
Lincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]]. His &quot;Western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Civil War Came|author=Boritt, Gabor S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=[[1997-05-29]]|isbn=0195113764|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|again, one person's opinion is presented as fact. Text seems to ignore the difference between prediction for the future &amp; hope for the future |date=June 2008}} On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.

Throughout the general election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, &quot;Honest Abe&quot; and &quot;the Rail-Splitter,&quot; were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p= 216}} See also: {{cite book|title=The First Lincoln Campaign|author=Luthin, Reinhard H.|publisher=Peter Smith Publishing|month=December |year=1987|isbn=0844612928}} and {{cite book|title=Ordeal of the Union Vol. 4|author=Nevins, Allan|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|date=[[1992-09-30]]|isbn=0020354452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.

==Presidency and the Civil War==
{{main|Origins of the American Civil War}}
With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West{{ndash}} the focal point of sectional tensions{{ndash}} was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.

===Secession winter 1860&amp;ndash;1861===
{{main|Baltimore Plot|Cornerstone Speech}}
As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead. By February 1, 1861, South Carolina was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.

Attempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]] which would have extended the Missouri line of 1820, were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln denounced it in private letters, saying &quot;either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. Sov. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

President-elect Lincoln [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins in Baltimore]], and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C.

[[Image:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the March 4, 1861 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of [[United States Capitol]].]]
At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the [[German American]] [[Turners]] formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection. In his [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|First Inaugural]] Address, Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,&quot; arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.

By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.

Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He &quot;temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis&quot;, overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The War for the Union Volume I.....The Improvised War 1861-1862|author=Nevins, Allan|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|date=[[1971-09-01]]|isbn=1568522967|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with Nevins's conclusions, it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Then a civilian, Sherman visited Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week, with his brother, Ohio Republican John Sherman. This meeting left the future General Sherman &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at Lincoln's seeming failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and the South was &quot;'preparing for war.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;WTS Memoirs 185-86 (Lib. of America ed., 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting begins: 1861&amp;ndash;1862===
{{main|American Civil War}}
In April 1861, after Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. [[Virginia]], which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Arkansas]].

The slave states of [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]] did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, [[Clement Vallandigham]], was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (''see'': [[Ex parte Merryman]]).

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's &quot;Emancipation Proclamation.&quot;

Ending slavery was always a primary goal of the Lincoln administration. However, the American public was slow to embrace the idea. In a shrewdly penned letter to Horace Greeley, editor of The New York Tribune, Lincoln masked his goal of ending slavery by making it subservient to the cause of preserving the union:

{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot;&amp;nbsp;... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm|title=Letter to Horace Greeley|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm|title=Letter to Albert G. Hodges|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online|date=[[1864-04-04]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], at the Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]] to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General [[George B. McClellan]] as commander of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Altoona|author=Pulling, Anne Frances|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|date=[[2001-06-11]]|isbn=0738505161|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As [[Frederick Douglass]] observed, Lincoln was, &quot;The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass|author=Douglass, Frederick|publisher=Digital Scanning|month=April |year=2001|isbn=1582183678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address===
{{main|Gettysburg Address}}
Although the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was a Union victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort. As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts were considered &quot;odious&quot; among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The [[New York Draft Riots]] of July, 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.

Writing to Lincoln in September 1863, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], [[Andrew Curtin]], warned that political sentiments were turning against Lincoln and the war effort:

{{quote|If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d2604300))|title=Andrew G. Curtin to Abraham Lincoln, Friday, September 4, 1863 (Politics in Pennsylvania) |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=[[1863-09-03]]|author=Curtin, Andrew G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], on November 19, beginning with the now-iconic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ge/GettysbuAd.html|title=Gettysburg Address|accessdate=2008-08-31|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Edition|month=May |year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press via [[Bartleby.com]]|quote=It is one of the most famous and most quoted of modern speeches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; phrase &quot;Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago...&quot;, Lincoln referred to the events of the [[Civil War]] and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to dedicate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to consecrate the living in the struggle to ensure that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.

===1864 election and second inauguration===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] in 1863, overall victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted [[Ulysses S. Grant]] General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.

[[Image:Lincoln second.jpg|thumb|right|The only known photographs of Lincoln giving a speech were taken as he delivered his second inaugural address. Here, he stands in the center, with papers in his hand.]]

Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Collapse of the Confederacy|author=Grimsley, Mark|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|date=[[2001-03-01]]|isbn=0803221703|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party and called the war a &quot;failure,&quot; their candidate, General [[George B. McClellan]], supported the war and repudiated the platform.

Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] capture of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

{{quote|Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.&quot; With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Conducting the war effort===
{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2008|lots of assertions (including several about Lincoln's state of mind ) &amp; there are only TWO references}}
[[Image:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|right|“Running the ‘Machine’”: An 1864 political cartoon featuring Lincoln; [[William P. Fessenden|William Fessenden]], [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration]]
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C. was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]].

[[Image:A&amp;TLincoln.jpg|thumb|left|An 1864 [[Mathew Brady]] photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]]]]

Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/hookbio.htm|title=Joseph Hooker|publisher=Civil War Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent [[Gettysburg Campaign]] replaced by [[George Meade]].

After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]]. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864 with a strategy of a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.

[[Image:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at Antietam]]
Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy farms and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and South Carolina. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States: A History of the Republic|author=Davidson, James West|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|month=April |year=1990|isbn=0139436979|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using [[African American]] troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.

Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During [[Jubal Anderson Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.

===Reconstruction===
{{main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the &quot;moderates&quot; regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], under [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House and [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin Wade]] in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.bartleby.com/43/37.html|title=Proclamation of Amnesty|publisher=[[Bartleby.com]]|year=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were [[Tennessee]], where Lincoln appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as governor, and [[Louisiana]], where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the war, Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson Davis's]] own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot; When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp=576, 580}};{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/richmond.htm|title=President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865|publisher=Eyewitness to History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln arrived back in Washington on the evening of April 9, 1865, the day Lee surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia. The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelincolnlog.org/view/show_date?day=09&amp;month=04&amp;year=1865|title=The Lincoln Log, April 9, 1865.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home front==
===Redefining Republicanism===
[[Image:Abraham Lincoln half length seated, April 10, 1865.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken in February 1865]]
Lincoln's [[rhetoric]] defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The [[Gettysburg Address]] defied Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.

In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln shifted emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values — what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential [[Cooper Union speech]], &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-Interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism|author=Diggins, John P.|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=[[1986-08-15]]|isbn=0226148777|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foner|1970|p= 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|1992|pp=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a &quot;republican form of government&quot; in every state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

In his [[Gettysburg Address]] Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, &quot;that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of [[state sovereignty]]. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked &quot;a new founding of the nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|1993|p= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties suspended===
During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a [[Union blockade|blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.

===Domestic measures===
Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, [[veto]]ing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[university|universities]] in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first [[income tax]] and higher [[tariff]]s. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. Congress created and Lincoln approved the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.

The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the [[United States Note]], the first [[banknote|paper currency]] in United States history. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.

During the war, Lincoln's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] effectively controlled all [[cotton]] trade in the occupied South — the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.

In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[death warrant]]s for convicted [[Santee|Santee Dakota]] who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for [[death penalty|execution]] (one was later [[reprieve]]d).

==Medical history==
Illnesses included: [[frostbite|frostbitten]] feet, [[malaria]], [[physical trauma]] and [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm|title=Maladies and Conditions|publisher=Doctor Zebra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that Lincoln had [[syphilis]] about 1835 have been controversial, but a recent analysis finds them credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vidal, Gore|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=324–326}} See also: {{cite journal|author=Fehrenbacher, Don E.|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=326–328}} and {{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln Sourcebook|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt.

As a child, Lincoln was tall for his age. He reached his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} no later than age 21. Friends noticed his arms, legs, hands, and feet were long. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed around 170&amp;nbsp;pounds before the Presidency, but lost weight while in the White House. Based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had [[Marfan syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gordon AM. Abraham Lincoln|journal=Kentucky Medical Association|month=March |year=1962|issue=60|pages=249–53|pmid= 13900423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's unremarkable [[cardiovascular]] history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory, and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Was George Washington Really the Father of Our Country?: A Clinical Geneticist Looks at World History |author=Marion, Robert|publisher=Perseus Books |month=February |year=1994|isbn=0201622556|pages=88–124}} See also: {{cite journal|author=Ready, Tinker |title=Access to presidential DNA denied|journal=[[Nature Medicine]]|year=1999|volume=5|issue=859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing Lincoln's [[DNA]] for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.

In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had [[multiple endocrine neoplasia]], type 2B (MEN2B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln: Finding the Genetic Cause of Abraham Lincoln's Height, Homeliness, Pseudo-Depression, and Imminent Cancer Death|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems|year=2008|url=http://www.physical-lincoln.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, [[constipation]], [[hypotonia]], a history compatible with [[cancer]] and a family history of the disorder - his sons [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]], and [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]], and probably his mother. The &quot;mole&quot; on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and &quot;pseudo-depression&quot; are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.

==Assassination==

[[Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives 2.png|right|thumb|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and [[John Wilkes Booth]]]]

Originally, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harrison, Lowell Hayes|title=Lincoln of Kentucky|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|year=2000|pages=3–4|isbn=0813121566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]].

Without his main bodyguard [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play (&quot;You sock-dologizing old man-trap&quot;), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber [[Henry Deringer]] at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; ({{lang-la|Thus always to tyrants}}) and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap.&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite book|author=Townsend, George Alfred|title=The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth|location=[[New York]]|publisher=[[Dick and Fitzgerald]]|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|thumb|left|Lincoln's [[funeral train]] carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son, William, 1,654&amp;nbsp;miles (2,661&amp;nbsp;km) to Illinois]]
An army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], initially assessed Lincoln's wound as [[Mortal Wound|mortal]]. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Ford's Theatre#Petersen House|Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] Joseph K. Barnes of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]]. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began &quot;Now he belongs to the...&quot; with some stating he said &quot;ages&quot; while others believe he said &quot;angels.&quot;&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; After Lincoln's body was returned to the [[White House]], a brain-only autopsy was performed, and his body was prepared for his [[lying in repose]] in the [[East Room]]. He was the first president to be assassinated or to [[Lying in state|lie in state]].

The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the [[Philadelphia Deringer]] pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood. The chair in which Lincoln was shot is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, [[copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant. The [[Lincoln Tomb]] in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177&amp;nbsp;feet (54&amp;nbsp;m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] had Lincoln [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.

==Presidential appointments==
===Administration and cabinet===
Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against him. Historians agree that, except for [[Simon Cameron]], it was a highly effective group.

==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
{{see|Abraham Lincoln and religion}}
In March 1860 in a speech in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.&quot; The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined &quot;seriously as a man of ideas.&quot; Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] version of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism]] who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by &quot;an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.&quot; It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2002|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject [[religion|organized religion]], but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as &quot;that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, &quot;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:

{{quote|The [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party&amp;mdash;and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true&amp;mdash;that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln’s religious [[skepticism]] was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and classical liberalism, especially [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;/&gt; Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,

{{quote|I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&amp;nbsp;… It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and memorials==
{{see|Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln}}
[[Image:TheApotheosisLincolnAndWashington1860s.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The Apotheosis'' of Abraham Lincoln, greeted by [[George Washington]] in heaven (an 1860s work)]]
Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]], often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.

Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]-supporting [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln National Corporation]]. The [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln automobile]] is also named after him. The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]] SS ''Nancy Hanks'' was named for his mother. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the American faction of the [[International Brigades]] named themselves the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]].

Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]. [[Lincoln, Illinois]], is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the U.S. [[United States five-dollar bill|Lincoln $5 bill]] and the [[Lincoln cent]], Lincoln's sculpture on the [[Mount Rushmore]], and the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theatre]], and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in [[Redlands, California]], is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for Illinois is ''Land of Lincoln''.

[[County (United States)|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Maine|Maine]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as [[Presidents Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]]. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, [[Lincoln's Birthday]]. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.

To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[ALBC]] is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace: [[Hodgenville]], [[Kentucky]].

Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]].

'''Aristotle''' (Greek: {{polytonic|Ἀριστοτέλης}} ''Aristotélēs'') (384 BC – 322 BC) was a Greek philosopher, a student of [[Plato]] and teacher of [[Alexander the Great]]. He wrote on many subjects, including physics, [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, logic, rhetoric, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology.

Together with Plato, and [[Socrates]] (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in [[Western philosophy]]. He was the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics. Aristotle's views on the [[Aristotelian physics|physical sciences]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the [[Renaissance]], although they were ultimately replaced by [[modern physics]]. In the biological sciences, some of his observations were only confirmed to be accurate in the nineteenth century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which were incorporated in the late nineteenth century into modern [[formal logic]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] had a profound influence on [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and it continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Eastern Orthodox theology]], and the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.

Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one third of the original works have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

{{cquote|Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth.|20|20|Aristotle}}

Aristotle was born in [[Stageira]], [[Chalcidice]] in 384 BC. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the [[aristocracy]]. At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in 347 BC. He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]]. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] to become tutor to [[Alexander the Great]].

After spending several years tutoring the young Alexander, Aristotle returned to Athens. By 335 BC, he established his own school there, known as the [[Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died, and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of [[Stageira]], who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. 3, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is during this period in Athens when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, vary significantly in both style and substance.

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, economics, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. [[Eurymedon the hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor.

==Logic==
{{main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}

Aristotle's conception of logic was the dominant form of logic until 19th century advances in [[mathematical logic]]. [[Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.

Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deduction]] system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Analytics and the ''Organon''===
{{main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''.&lt;ref&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's scientific method==

{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle, however, found the universal in [[particular]] things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and included fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;[[scientific method]]&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, [[mathematics]] and metaphysics.

If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics, Mathematics, (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.
[[Image:Perseid Meteor.jpg|thumb|A green and red [[Perseids|Perseid]] meteor is striking the sky just below the Milky Way in August 2007.]]
His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that the more massive object falls faster than a less massive object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's [[scientific method]] assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe ([[geocentrism]]).

Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

==Physics==
{{main|Physics (Aristotle)}}
===The five elements===
{{main|Classical element}}
*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry.
*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry.
*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet.
*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet.
*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.

===Causality, The Four Causes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Retrocausality]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Four causes}}
*The [[material cause]] is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its part, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination), a relationship known as the part-whole causation. Simply put it is the influence of the material substances on the event. So imagine two dominos, the first of which is lighter. The first is knocked over into the second but does not have enough power to knock it over, this is Material cause.
*The [[formal cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put it is the influence of the form (essence) of the things on the event. So take the two dominos again except this time the second is shaped to prevent it from falling *eg. triangular.* this is formal cause.
*The [[efficient cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause.
*The [[final cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.
Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

All further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal ([[Thomas Aquinas]]), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).

===Chance and spontaneity===
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;

===Substance, potentiality and actuality===
Aristotle examines the concept of substance (''[[ousia]]'') in his ''[Metaphysics'', Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the [[substratum]] or the stuff of which it is composed, ''e.g.'' the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house. While the form of the substance, is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10-30&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''kinesis'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: 1) growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; 2) locomotion, which is change in space; and 3) alteration, which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality]] (''dynamis'') and [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]] (''entelecheia'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant.

&quot; For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, the matter of the house is its potentiality and the form is its actuality. The [[formal cause]] (''aitia'') then of that change from potential to actual house, is the [[reason]] (''logos'') of the house builder and the [[final cause]] is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.

With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, ''e.g.'', what is that makes the man one? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a-b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universals and particulars===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a contemporary philosopher that agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.

One way for contemporary philosophers to justify this position is by asserting the [[eleatic principle]].

In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

==Biology and medicine==
In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals, but not humans and his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

===Empirical research program===
[[Image:Octo2.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]
[[Image:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] ([[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''[[Octopus]]'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]

Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.

He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of living things===
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the nineteenth century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[haemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).

For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[formal cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had a multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.

===Theory of biological forms and souls===
Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3 &lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348 &lt;/ref&gt;

His analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a [[Misogyny|misogynist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Aristotle's successor: Theophrastus===
[[Image:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC]]
{{main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum}}
Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany&amp;mdash;the ''[[Historia Plantarum|History of Plants]]''&amp;mdash;which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Hellenistic medicine===
{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the circulatory system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between skin and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few modern [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical Philosophy==
===Ethics===
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical science, i.e., one mastered by doing rather than merely reasoning. Further, Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (such as metaphysics or [[epistemology]]) but is general knowledge. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, ''[[Nichomachean Ethics]]'', in which he outlines what is commonly called [[virtue ethics]].

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that man must have a function uncommon to anything else, and that this function must be an activity of the soul. Aristotle identified the best activity of the soul as [[eudaimonia]]: a happiness or joy that pervades the good life. Aristotle taught that to achieve the good life, one must live a balanced life and avoid excess. This balance, he taught, varies among different persons and situations, and exists as a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] between two vices - one an excess and one a deficiency.

===Politics===
{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | pages =59 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior to the [[family]] which in turn is prior to the individual, i.e., last in the order of becoming, but first in the order of being &lt;!-- (1253a19-24) --&gt;. He is also famous for his statement that &quot;man is by nature a political animal.&quot; Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a [[machine]], and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.

It should be noted that the modern understanding of a political community is that of the state. However, the state was foreign to Aristotle. He referred to political communities as cities. Aristotle understood a city as a political &quot;partnership&quot; &lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt; and not one of a [[social contract]] (or compact) or a political community as understood by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Subsequently, a city is created not to avoid injustice or for economic stability &lt;!-- (1280b29-31) --&gt;, but rather to live a good life: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&quot; &lt;!-- (1281a1-3) --&gt;. This can be distinguished from the social contract theory which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomacean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric and poetics===
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by media, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation - through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

==The loss of his works==
According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;exoteric&quot; and the &quot;esoteric&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1102a26-27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408-410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic]] school&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works (esoteric) intended for the narrower audience of Aristotle's students and other philosophers who were familiar with the jargon and issues typical of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant - that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?&lt;ref&gt;The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor [[Theophrastus]], who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the first century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrranion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].

[[Carnes Lord]] attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Lord
 |first=Carnes
 |title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle
 |publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]
 |year=1984
 |location=Chicago
 |pages=11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelean corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelean interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

As the influence of the ''falsafa'' grew in the West, in part due to [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translations and the spread of [[Averroism]], the demand for Aristotle's works grew. [[William of Moerbeke]] translated a number of them into Latin. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in [[Europe]], and ultimately revitalizing European thought through Muslim influence in Spain to fan the embers of the Renaissance.

[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a 15th-century-A.D. scholar.]]
It is the opinion of many that Aristotle's system of thought remains the most influential one ever put together by any single mind. According to historian [[Will Durant]], no other philosopher has contributed so much to the enlightenment of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |pages= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He single-handedly founded the sciences of [[Logic]], [[Biology]] and [[Psychology]]. At the opposite pole, [[Bertrand Russell]] dismissed much of Aristotle's work as not particularly profound.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. (Alexander's tutelage under Aristotle should also be mentioned here, though it is unclear what the influence of this relationship was.)

Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''At his bedded hed''
:''Twenty books clothed in blake or red''
:''Of Aristotle and his philosophie''
The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],
:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''
:''Amid the philosophic family,''
:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''
:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''
:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue - or ''arete'' - of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''This article is about the Gershwin composition. For the 1951 musical starring Gene Kelly, see [[An American in Paris (film)]].''
 
'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[European-influenced classical music|symphonic]] composition by American composer [[George Gershwin]], composed in 1928. Inspired by time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it is in the form of an extended [[tone poem]] evoking the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed the piece on commission from the [[New York Philharmonic]]. He also did the [[orchestration]]. (He did not orchestrate his musicals.) Gershwin scored ''An American in Paris'' for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]], and automobile horns. Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition which took place on [[December 13]], [[1928]] in [[Carnegie Hall]] with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the New York Philharmonic.

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot; When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness.&quot; But, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; The American visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;

== Instrumentation ==
''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in B flat, [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 taxi horns, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], and [[String section|strings]].

== Recordings ==
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded over the years.  The very first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.  Later, [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.

In 1951, MGM released a musical comedy, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winner of numerous awards, including the 1951 Best Picture Oscar, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around Gershwin's symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green).

A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.

The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as the '''Oscars''', are awards of merit presented annually by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize excellence of professionals in the [[film industry]], including directors, actors, and writers. The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is among the oldest, most prominent, most prestigious, and most watched [[film awards|film award]] ceremonies in the world.

The [[1st Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on Thursday, May 16, 1929, at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 and 1928. It was hosted by actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and director [[William C. DeMille]].

The [[81st Academy Awards]] honoring the best [[2008 in film|in film for 2008]] will be held on Sunday, February 22, 2009 at the [[Kodak Theater]] in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.04.14a.html Retrieved 2008-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first awards were presented at a private dinner in Hollywood, with an audience of less than 250 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index2.html|title=About the Academy Awards &lt;small&gt;(page 2)&lt;/small&gt;|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|format=HTML|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first year the awards have been publicly broadcasted, at first by radio then by TV after 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;/&gt; During the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 p.m. at the night of the awards; this method was ruined when the [[Los Angeles Times]] announced the winners before the ceremony began, as a result the Academy has since used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=English|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the awards have been broadcast from the Kodak Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

==Oscar statuette==
[[Image:Academy Award Oscar (cropped).JPG|thumb|widthpx|]]
===Design===
The official name of the Oscar [[statuette]] is the ''Academy Award of Merit''. Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a [[knight]] rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusade|crusader's]] [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscar.com/legacy/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican actor [[Emilio Fernandez|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose naked to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;.
Then sculptor George Stanley sculpted Gibbons's design in clay, and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent [[copper]] and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes for Golnaz Rahimi. Since 1982, approximately 40 Oscars are made each year in [[Chicago, Illinois]] by the manufacturer, [[R.S. Owens]]&lt;ref&gt;see rsowens.com&lt;/ref&gt;. If they fail to meet strict quality control standards, the statuettes are cut in half and melted down.  In support of the American effort in [[World War II]], the statues were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2|title= Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming ===
The root of the name ''Oscar'' is contested. One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher= The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[TIME Magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html &quot;Oscars&quot;], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://firstmention.com/oscars.aspx|title= The Oscars, 1936|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that of the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, who first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her Uncle Oscar. Columnist Qiang Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot; (Levy 2003). Both ''Oscar'' and ''Academy Award'' are registered trademarks of the Academy, fiercely protected through litigation and threats thereof.

As of the [[80th Academy Awards]] ceremony held in 2008, a total of 2,701 Oscars have been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 293 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.

==Nomination==
===Voters===
AMPAS, a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,829 as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news. aol. com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=2008-01-30 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes for Oscars have been tabulated and certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url = http://news. bbc. co. uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher = BBC News|author = Jackie Finlay|date= 2006–03–03|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All A. M. P. A. S. members must be invited to join. Invitation comes from the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures. Although winning an Academy Award usually results in an invitation to join, membership is not automatic. {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing until 2003, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www. oscars. org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into 15 branches, representing different disciplines in motion pictures. Members whose work does not fall within one of the branches may belong to a group known as &quot;Members at Large. &quot;{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Rules===
Today, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/rules/rule02.html
   |title      = Rule Two: Eligibility
   |publisher  = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 2 states that a film must be &quot;feature-length&quot;, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280x720]].

The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/rules/rule05.html

   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[79th Academy Awards]], 847 members (past and present) of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] have been nominated for an Oscar (in all categories).

==Ceremony==
===Telecast===
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers typically do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.) The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources. Neither has the Academy explained how it has reached this figure.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]) and gathers millions of viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher = Oscars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html Nielsen - Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[tape delay]] in the West Coast.

The Awards show was first televised on [[NBC]] in 1953. [[NBC]] continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which [[NBC]] resumed the broadcasts. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it currently usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[Nielsen Ratings#&quot;Sweeps&quot;|sweeps]] period. (The ceremony was moved into early March during 2006, in deference to the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].) The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 38 wins and 167 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in [[Washington, D.C.]] On October 16, 2006, the awards event itself was designated a [[National Special Security Event]] by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Ratings===
Lisa De Moraes from the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Tom O'Neill from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and [[Richard Corliss]] from ''[[TIME]]'' have pointed out that the ceremony telecast has an interesting history of unusual up-and-down ratings trend since [[Nielsen Ratings]] were measured for the ceremony since [[39th Academy Awards|1967]] and audience size was recorded since [[46th Academy Awards|1974]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits were favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast in [[70th Academy Awards|1998]], the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$500 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html Business &amp; Technology | Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | Seattle Times Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=January 26, 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture, ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.94 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party | publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with a 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another low-budget, independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]''), which generated US$64.3 million prior to the ceremony.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

==Venues==
The [[1st Academy Awards]] were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Subsequent banquet ceremonies in the 1930s and early 40s were held in [[Los Angeles]] at either [[The Ambassador Hotel]] or the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

[[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at the Academy's then-headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theater (Hollywood)|Pantages Theater]]. The Oscars then moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in the [[Los Angeles Music Center]]. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion hosted 19 consecutive Oscar ceremonies until 1988, when the Academy started to alternate between the Music Center and the Shrine Auditorium.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Kodak Theater]] became the first permanent home of the awards. It is connected to the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood &amp; Highland Center]], which contains &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;640,000&amp;nbsp;square feet&amp;nbsp;(59,000&amp;nbsp;m²)&lt;/span&gt; of space including retail, restaurants, nightclubs, other establishments and a six-screen cinema. In fact, the Grand Staircase columns at the Kodak Theatre showcase every movie that has won the Best Picture title since the first Academy Awards in 1929.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

==Criticism==
{{lit criticism}}
Critics have noted that many Best Picture Academy Award winners in the past have not stood the test of time. Several of these films, such as ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moviecitynews.com/columnists/pratt/2004/around_world_80_56.html|title=Reviewed: Around the World in 80 Days

DeMille]]'s ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/greatest_show_on_earth/ |title=The Greatest Show on Earth|publisher=rottentomatoes|accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often considered to have aged poorly and to have little of the impact they had on their initial release. Several films that currently have wide critical approval were not named Best Picture, such as the highly acclaimed ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]], and ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', all directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/noawards.html|title=Academy Awards Mistakes and Omissions|publisher=filmsite.org|author=Tim Dirks|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' directed by [[Frank Darabont]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] has said, &quot;I lost faith in the Oscars the first year I was a movie critic -- the year that ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' didn't win.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Playboy 20q&quot;, [http://www.playboy.com/magazine/20q_archive/siskel-and-ebert.html Playboy],&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that actors are at a disadvantage in [[comedy]] roles, as relatively few acting awards have been given for performances in films considered primarily comedic. [[Jack Black]], [[John C. Reilly]], and [[Will Ferrell]] joked about this at the [[79th Academy Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;

Nonetheless, each of the acting categories boasts notable examples of Oscar-winning performances in comedic roles. These include Best Actors [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]] in ''[[The Philadelphia Story]]'' and [[Jack Nicholson]] in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''; Best Actresses [[Judy Holliday]] in ''[[Born Yesterday]]'', [[Glenda Jackson]] in ''[[A Touch of Class]]'' and [[Helen Hunt]] in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''; Best Supporting Actors [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Mister Roberts (film)|Mister Roberts]]'', [[Alan Arkin]] in ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and [[Kevin Kline]] in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]''; and Best Supporting Actresses [[Josephine Hull]] in ''[[Harvey]]'', [[Marisa Tomei]] in ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'', [[Goldie Hawn]] in ''[[Cactus Flower]]'' and [[Jessica Lange]] in ''[[Tootsie]]''. {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Studios also lobby heavily for their films to be considered, leading to the complaint that nominations and awards may be largely a result of this lobbying rather than the quality of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Since the Oscars have become more popular in recent years, a great deal of film writing on the internet has been disproportionately focused towards the Oscar race. The web sites center around Oscar &quot;buzz&quot; and invite the readers to speculate throughout the year over which films might get selected. Even official media outlets such as the ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[Toronto Star]]'' have joined the trend and launched their own websites.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

The Oscars have also been criticized for neglecting films not in the [[English language]]; all 81 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] recipients have been in English (although ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' contains a significant proportion of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] dialog). To date, only eight non-English films have been nominated for Best Picture (of 463 total): ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|Grand Illusion]]'' (French, 1938); ''[[Z (film)|Z]]'' (French, 1969); ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]'' (Swedish, 1972); ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (Swedish, 1973); ''[[Il Postino]]'' (Italian/Spanish, 1995); ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (Italian, 1998); ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' ([[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], 2000); and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (Japanese, 2006). Classic non-English films such as ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'', ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'', ''[[8½]]'', ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Tokyo Story]]'', ''[[L'Atalante]]'', and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' were not even nominated.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In the first year of the awards, the Best Director category was split into separate Drama and Comedy categories. At times, the Best Original Score category has been split into separate Drama and Comedy/Musical categories. Today, the Best Original Score category is one category. From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume Design awards were split into separate categories for black and white and color films.

'''''Actrius''''' (''Actresses'') is a [[1996 in film|1996 film]] directed by [[Ventura Pons]]. In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.

==Synopsis==
In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by [[Núria Espert]]), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by [[Rosa Maria Sardà]]) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by [[Anna Lizaran]]).

[[Image:Animalia.jpg|thumb|240px|Animalia cover]]'''''Animalia''''' (ISBN 0810918684) is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]].  It was published in [[1986]].  

''Animalia'' is an [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words.  The illustrations contain dozens of small objects that the curious reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture. In 1987, ''Animalia'' won the title of Honour Book in the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] Picture Book of the Year Awards. In 1996, a tenth anniversary edition was released.

Base also published a [[colouring book]] version [http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?qwork=7937230&amp;wauth=Base%2C%20Graeme&amp;matches=16&amp;qsort=r&amp;cm_re=works*listing*title] for children to do their own colouring.

A [[Animalia (TV series)|television series]] was also created, based on the book, which airs in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK.

'''International Atomic Time''' ('''[http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html TAI]''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''Temps Atomique International''') is a high-precision atomic [[time standard]] that tracks [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].  It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]], and the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. [[As of 2007]], TAI is exactly 33 seconds ahead of UTC: an initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 23 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 31 December 2008, a leap second will be added to UTC, leaving TAI 34 seconds ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/time/leapseconds.html |title=December 2008 leap second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since.

==Operation==

TAI as a [[frequency]] standard is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using satellites (see [http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/clock_comparisons.html BIPM clock comparisons]).  Many of these are [[caesium]] atomic clocks, which are the standard by which the [[SI]] [[second]] is defined.  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone.

The participating institutions each broadcast in [[real time]] a frequency signal with [[time code]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  (Actually the time codes are usually published in the form of UTC.)  The better laboratories' signals are mutually synchronised to within less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; s, but there are outliers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; s out.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''TAI(NPL)'' (''UTC(NPL)'' for the UTC form), where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  Some laboratories also publish their own atomic time scale, denoted in the form ''TA(USNO)'' (''USNO'' identifies the [[United States Naval Observatory]]).

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(x) and TAI-TA(x), for each participating institution x.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  See the article on TT for more information.

==History==

Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL).  The first formalised atomic time scale was the ''A.1'' scale defined by USNO in 1959.  A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) at the [[UT2]] instant JD 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) as calculated at USNO.  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several [[centisecond]]s.  A.1 was extrapolated backwards to 1956.

In 1961, the [[Bureau International de l'Heure]] (BIH) (later superseded by the BIPM and the IERS) constructed an atomic time scale named ''AM'' based on three atomic clocks.  The clocks were compared by listening to radio [[time signal]]s based on them.  The BIH's time scale was synchronised with A.1's epoch, and extrapolated back to 1955 using time signals from the first caesium clock at NPL.  This time scale was soon renamed from AM to ''A3''.

Also in 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximates [[UT1]].  This was a [[compromise]] arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.

In 1967 the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock.

More clocks were added to the A3 time scale from 1967, and it was renamed to ''TA''.  Finally in 1971 it was renamed ''TAI''.

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the [[altitude]]s of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1977-01-01T00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.

In the 1990s, annual periodic variations in the rate of some clocks were traced to [[blackbody radiation]] that varies with the ambient [[temperature]].  It became clear that a correction for this was required.  Accordingly, in 1997 the BIPM declared that the definition of the SI second referred to a caesium atom at rest and at [[absolute zero]] temperature.  Temperature corrections were implemented in TAI from 1995 to 1998, speeding TAI up by about 10&lt;sup&gt;-14.3&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{wiktionary|altruism}}
'''Altruism''' is selfless concern for the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of others. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures, and central to many religious traditions. This idea was often described as the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule of ethics]].  Altruism is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]] and [[duty]]. Altruism focuses on a motivation to help others or a want to do [[good and evil|good]] without reward, while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (for example, [[God]], a [[monarch|king]]), a specific organization (for example, a [[government]]), or an abstract concept (for example, [[patriotism]] etc). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is giving without regard to reward or the benefits of recognition. 

The concept has a long history in [[philosophical]] and [[ethical]] thought, and has more recently become a topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[sociologists]], [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. While ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism. Researches on altruism were sparked in particular after the murder of [[Kitty Genovese]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt; Vinciane Despret, ''Naissance d'une théorie éthologique - la danse du cratérope écaillé'', Les Empêcheurs de penser en rond, 1996, p.38 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was stabbed during half an hour, with passive witnesses withholding themselves from helping her.

==Altruism in social sciences==&lt;!--Problem of love redirects here--&gt;
{{Original research|date=July 2008}}
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}
If one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives on how &quot;benefit&quot; (or &quot;interest&quot;) should be defined. A material gain (for example, money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being philosophically identical benefits.  Knox (1999) ultimately argues that &quot;Altruistic volunteers are either not truly altruistic or not rational&quot;

For illustration of this, Knox (1999) describes circumstances which he terms as &quot;the volunteers folly&quot;. In his example a lawyer volunteers his time on the weekends to help build low cost housing - professing that his motivation to do so is to help provide housing for the needy.  However, Knox identifies that this is not the proper way for a lawyer to serve that particular interest. Since the lawyer's work as a lawyer generates far more money than his work on the building site is worth, Knox suggests that he should simply put in more work as a lawyer and donate the proceeds of that work. This would serve his professed purpose to a higher degree, since that money would afford the project several times more work than he himself could provide to the project directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;knox&quot;&gt;Knox, Trevor, ''The Volunteer's Folly and Socio-Economic Man: Some Thoughts On Altruism, Rationality, and Community'', Journal of Socio-Economics 28 (1999), 475-492&lt;/ref&gt;

Some may find this logic disagreeable or counterintuitive as an ideation of altruism, because it seems to require that martyrdom — or fatal sacrifice for a greater cause — be the only actualization of altruism.

Psychological egoism can be accused of using [[circular logic]].  For instance, an egoist would not disagree with the following [[syllogism]]: &quot;If a person has willingly performed an act, then he/she has manifested such intent in the form of that act.  Fulfillment of one's desires is the primary requisite of satisfaction.  Ergo, a person can only willingly perform acts that result in his/her personal enjoyment.&quot;  This logic is sometimes viewed as circular or presumptuous.  Specifically, egoism leans on the assumption that satisfaction is synonymous with self-satisfaction.  Such a precept automatically sidesteps counterpoint, however, and remains [[unfalsifiable]].  Thus, until [[empirical evidence]] favors one view or the other, egoism must acquiesce to [[uncertainty]]. 

Humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don't know and will never meet. For example, some humans donate to international [[Charitable organization|charities]] and volunteer their time to help [[society]]'s less fortunate. It can however be argued that an individual would contribute to a charity to gain respect or stature within his/her own community.
 
Beginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place.



===Digital altruism===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=August 2008}}
Digital altruism is one of the major user motivations for contributing to virtual communities such as [[social media]], [[social learning]] and other web sites which feature user-generated content. It is related to the basic human need to contribute to a greater good, outside of the market-space and free of self-interest. The digital nature of this motivation is important because, thanks to the combination of new technologies that facilitate de-localized communication and new web sites which make contributing easy, fun and rewarding, altruistic needs can be more easily balanced with self-interested responsibilities (work, family, leisure).

==Altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology==
{{main|Altruism in animals|Evolutionary ethics}}
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behavior), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Researchers on alleged altruist behaviours among animals have been ideologically opposed to the [[social darwinism|social darwinist]] concept of the &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;, under the name of &quot;survival of the nicest&quot;&amp;mdash;the latter being globally compatible, however, with [[darwinism|darwinist]]' [[theory of evolution]]. Insistence on such cooperative behaviours between animals was first exposed by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''.

Recent developments in [[game theory]] (see [[ultimatum game]]) have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:

* Behavioural manipulation (for example, by certain [[parasites]] that can alter the behavior of the host)
* [[Bounded rationality]] (for example, [[Herbert Simon]])
* [[Conscience]]
* [[Kin selection]] including [[eusociality]] (see also &quot;[[selfish gene]]&quot;)
* [[Meme]]s (by influencing behavior to favour their own spread, for example, [[religion]])
* [[Reciprocal altruism]], mutual aid
* Selective investment theory &lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.L. &amp; Brown, R.M. (2006).

* [[Sexual selection]], in particular, the [[Handicap principle]]
* [[Reciprocity (social psychology)]]
** Indirect reciprocity (for example, [[reputation]])
** Strong reciprocity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Pseudo-reciprocity

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similarities to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623-15628)&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed their interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

A new study by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in [[New Mexico]], US, is seen by some as breathing new life into the model of [[group selection]] for Altruism, known as &quot;Survival of the nicest&quot;. Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including [[Australian aboriginals]], native [[Siberian]] [[Inuit]] populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa. It was found that [[hunter-gatherer]] bands of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than was previously thought.  Under these conditions, thought to be similar to those of the middle and upper [[Paleolithic]], altruism towards other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group. 

If an individual defended the group but was killed, any genes that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed on.  Early customs such as food sharing or [[monogamy]] could have levelled out the “cost” of altruistic behaviour, in the same way that income taxes redistribute income in society. He assembled genetic, climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations.  In his model, members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a &quot;tax&quot; by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit from sharing food and information, thereby increasing the average fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness. Bands of altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other groups at this challenging time in history.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Richard (07 December 2006) &quot;Why altruism paid off for our ancestors&quot; (NewScientist.com news service) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10750.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Altruist theories in evolutionary biology were contested by [[Amotz Zahavi]], the inventor of the signal theory and its correlative, the [[handicap principle]], based mainly on his observations of the [[Arabian Babbler]], a bird commonly known for its surprising (alleged) altruistic behaviours.

==Altruism and religion==
{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
Most, if not all, of the world's [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]] place particular emphasis on altruistic morality, as noted above, but [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]] and many other religions also promote altruistic behavior. 

Altruism was central to the teachings of [[Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel]] especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love,&quot; as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception'', Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. If love, which confirms others in their freedom, shuns propagandas and masks, assurance of its presence is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love become validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the doing.

Though it might seem obvious that altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus, one important and influential strand of Christianity would qualify this. [[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', I:II Quaestion 26, Article 4 states that we should love ourselves more than our neighbour. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22 is interpreted by St Thomas as meaning that love for ourself is the exemplar of love for others. He does think though, that we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbour, taken as an entirety, more than our bodily life, since the ultimate purpose of love of our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude, a more desirable thing than bodily well being. Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, now part of mainstream Catholicism, in coining the word Altruism, as stated above.

===Sikhism===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=April 2008}}
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. In the late 1600s, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to  both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
&quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied Bhai Kanhaiya. 
The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot; 

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps till to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.

It is claimed by some Sikhs that Bhai Kanhaiya's successors who continued the tradition of serving others and who committed their lives to service of the sick and wounded lived longer than usual life spans.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Bhai Kanhaiya’s successors were not related genetically in order to account for their exceptional longevity. Rather they were volunteers from the Sikh organizations who committed their lives to serve the sick; first they did it themselves and then they recruited others to do the same. All of them defied the recorded longevity norms of the time for a long span of over three centuries.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Longevity is determined by many factors, freedom from disease and stress are two such factors. The altruists were certainly observed to live calm and tranquil lives. For Sikhs, altruism was made an act of faith by their founders.
 &lt;!-- This section should continue by quoting altruism-related verses from the holy books of the aforementioned religions --&gt;

'''Ayn Rand''' ({{IPAEng|ˈaɪn ˈrænd}}, {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}} &amp;ndash; March 6, 1982), born '''Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum''' ({{lang-ru|Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}), was a [[Russia]]n-born [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], [[philosopher]],&lt;ref&gt;Her ''New York Times'' obituary (May 7, 1982, p. 7) identifies her as &quot;writer and philosopher.&quot; She was not an academician. Some sources simply label her a &quot;philosopher,&quot; others prefer language such as &quot;espoused a philosophy.&quot; One writer comments: &quot;Perhaps because she so eschewed academic philosophy, and because her works are rightly considered to be works of literature, Objectivist philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy. Yet throughout literary academia, Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher. Her works merit consideration as works of philosophy in their own right.&quot; (Jenny Heyl, 1995, as cited in {{cite book|title=Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand|editor=Mimi R Gladstein, Chris Matthew Sciabarra(eds)|id=ISBN 0-271-01831-3|publisher=Penn State Press|year=1999 |pages=p.17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]]. She is widely known for her best-selling novels ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', and for developing a philosophical system called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].

Rand advocated rational [[individualism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]], categorically rejecting [[socialism]], [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and [[religion]]. Her ideas remain both influential and controversial.

==Early life==
===Childhood and education===
Ayn Rand was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and was the eldest of three daughters (Alisa, Natasha, and Nora)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asenseoflife.com/synopsis.html|title=''A Sense of Life''|accessdate=2006-03-22}} website of the documentary film about Rand's life.&lt;/ref&gt; of Zinovy Zacharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum, [[agnosticism|agnostic]] and largely non-observant ethnic [[Jew]]s. Her father was a [[chemist]] and a successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur who earned the privilege of living outside the [[Jewish Pale of Settlement|Pale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/fc1.html|title=&quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical—Published Reviews.&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From an early age, Alisa displayed an interest in literature and film. Throughout her youth, Rand read the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] and other Romantic writers, of whom [[Victor Hugo]] was her favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Ninety-Three | first = Victor | last = Hugo | publisher = NBI Press (1968)}} Translated by Lowell Bair, with an introduction by Ayn Rand; pp. ''vii, xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Twelvecollegia.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ayn Rand studied history and philosophy at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] .]]Rand was twelve at the time of the [[Russian revolution of 1917]], and her family life was disrupted by the rise of the [[Bolshevik]] party. Her father's pharmacy was confiscated by the Soviets, and the family fled to the [[Crimea]] to recover financially. Rand then returned to Saint Petersburg to attend the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/rand.htm|title=&quot;Ayn Rand&quot;|date=[[2006-03-22]]}} at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; where she majored in history and also studied philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm Chris Matthew Sciabarra, &quot;The Rand Transcript&quot;, ''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'' vol. 1, iss. 1 (1999): 1-26]&lt;/ref&gt; discovering the literary works of [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] as well as the philosophical works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], admiring his depiction of a heroic and independent individual in ''[[Thus Spake Zarathustra]]''. She completed a three-year program in the department of Social Pedagogy that included history, philology and law, graduating in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sciabarra, Chris Matthew. {{cite web|title=&quot;The Rand Transcript.&quot;|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm|
accessdate=2006-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rand continued to write short stories and screenplays. She entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting; in late 1925, however, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives.

===Immigration and marriage===
In February 1926, she arrived in the [[United States]] at the age of 21, entering by ship through [[New York City]], which would ultimately become her home. After a brief stay with her relatives in [[Chicago]], she resolved never to return to the [[Soviet Union]], and set out for [[Hollywood]] to become a [[screenwriter]]. Already using ''Rand'' as a [[Cyrillic]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]&lt;ref name=&quot;name-ari&quot;/&gt; of her surname, she then adopted the name ''Ayn'', of disputed origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;name-ari&quot;&gt;Possibly the contraction of the last three letters of her surname in handwritten Cyrillic which strongly resemble the three Roman letters a.y.n.
ARI Biographical researcher Drs. Gotthelf and Berliner note that while still in Russia, Anna used the name &quot;Rand&quot;, which is a Cyrillic contraction of Rosenbaum. They also note a hypothesis about a Finnish origin of Ayn.
{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_faq_index2#ar_q3b|title=&quot;What is the origin of &quot;Rand&quot;?&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rand struggled in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance face-to-face meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings]],'' and subsequent work as a script reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_aynrand_biography |title=&quot;Ayn Rand Biography&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-23}} at AynRand.org &lt;/ref&gt; She also worked as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiendecker&quot;&gt; Leiendecker, Harold. {{cite web|url=http://www.eckerd.edu/aspec/writers/atlas_shrugged.htm|title=&quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on the film, she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]], who caught her eye. The two married on April 15, 1929, and remained married for fifty years, until O'Connor's death in 1979 at the age of 82. Rand became a [[Naturalization|naturalized American citizen]] in 1931.

==Fiction==
Rand explained in a 1963 essay titled &quot;The Goal of My Writing&quot; that the goal of her fiction was to project her vision of an ideal man, and she developed her philosophy largely to support that goal.

In an article about Rand that appeared in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 1999, it is stated that &quot;Rand’s novels sell some 300,000 copies a year, exhorting readers to think big about themselves, build big and earn big. New editions of all her books carry postcards for readers who might be inclined to learn more about Objectivism, the author’s credo, a blending of free markets, reason and individualism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Still Spouting,&quot; The Economist, November 25, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===

Her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''Red Pawn'' in 1932 to [[Universal Studios]]: &quot;[[Josef Von Sternberg|Von Sternberg]] later considered it for [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], but Russian scenarios were out of favour and the project was dropped.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;&gt;Turner, Jenny. {{cite web|title=&quot;As Astonishing as Elvis&quot;|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n23/turn03_.html|date=[[2006-03-24]]}} Review of Jeff Briting's biography, ''Ayn Rand''.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand then wrote the play ''[[The Night of January 16]]'' in 1934, which was produced on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. The play was a [[courtroom drama]] in which a [[jury]] chosen from the audience decided the verdict, leading to one of two possible endings.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;A Sense of Life&quot; homepage. &lt;/ref&gt;

Rand then published the novel ''[[We the Living]]'' in 1936, which focused on life in Communist Russia. Rand described it as &quot;the most autobiographical of her novels&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/rand.htm|title=&quot;Ayn Rand&quot;|date=2006-03-23}} at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Its harsh anti-communist tone met with mixed reviews in the U.S., where the period of [[The Great Depression]] was sometimes known as &quot;[[The Red Decade]]&quot; in reference to the high-water mark of sympathy for socialist ideals. Stephen Cox, at [[The Objectivist Center]], observed that ''We the Living'' &quot;was published at the height of Russian socialism's popularity among leaders of American opinion. It failed to attract an audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot;&gt;Cox, Stephen. {{cite web|title=&quot;Anthem: An appreciation.&quot;|url=http://www.theatlassociety.org/cox_anthem_appreciation.asp|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''We the Living'' was first completed in 1934, but was rejected by several publishers, until 1936, when [[George Platt Brett]] of [[Macmillan Publishing]] agreed to publish her book.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand then wrote the novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]],'' a [[dystopian]] vision of a futuristic society where collectivism has triumphed. ''Anthem'' did not find a publisher in the United States and was first published in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1938.

===''The Fountainhead''===
{{Main|The Fountainhead}}

Rand's first major professional success came with her best-selling novel ''The Fountainhead'' (1943), which she wrote over a period of seven years. Its plot centered on a young architect named [[Howard Roark]] and revolved around the conflict between independent thinkers and &quot;second-handers.&quot; The novel was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] publishing house, upon the insistence of editorial board member Archibald Ogden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cato&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/fountainhead.html|title=&quot;''The Fountainhead''&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-30 |publisher=[[Cato Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. In the sixty years since it was published, it has sold six million copies, and continues to sell about 100,000 copies per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cato&quot;/&gt;

In 1949 Rand's novel was made into a [[The Fountainhead (film)|major motion picture]] by [[Warner Brothers]] with [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Patricia Neal]]; Rand wrote the screenplay.
Following the success of ''The Fountainhead'', she wrote screenplays for two other movies, ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.

===''Atlas Shrugged''===

{{Main|Atlas Shrugged}}

Rand's [[magnum opus]], ''Atlas Shrugged,'' was published in 1957. Due to the success of ''The Fountainhead,'' the initial printing ran to 100,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Whittaker Chambers|Chambers, Whittaker]].{{cite web|title=&quot;Big Sister is Watching You.&quot;|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback200501050715.asp|accessdate=2006-03-24}} Reprint of contemporary review of ''Atlas Shrugged'' from ''[[National Review]].''&lt;/ref&gt; and the book went on to become an international bestseller. Sales of ''Atlas Shrugged'' remained strong in subsequent decades, and it has been cited by many interviewees as the book that most influenced them. (See [[#Popular interest and influence|''Popular interest and influence'']], below.)

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is the role of man's mind in society. It advocates the core tenets of Objectivism and expresses Rand's belief in human greatness. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States of America in which industrialists and other creative individuals go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent [[Free market|free economy]]. The characters describe this as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by effectively removing those in control of the nation's production, creativity, and thinking. Through this strike, they aim to demonstrate that without them society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and [[science fiction]], and deals with other diverse issues as wide-ranging as sex, music, medicine, politics, philosophy, industry, and human ability. ''Atlas Shrugged'' contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism of any in her works of fiction, including a lengthy monologue delivered by the novel's [[hero]], [[John Galt (Atlas Shrugged)|John Galt]].

==Philosophy: Objectivism==
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Ayn Rand and the history of philosophy}}

Rand's philosophical system, Objectivism, encompasses positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[politics]] and [[aesthetics]].

Objectivism embraces [[objective reality]] in [[metaphysics]], [[reason]] in [[epistemology]], and [[rational egoism]] in ethics. In [[politics]] she was a proponent of laissez-faire capitalism and [[individual rights]], believing that the sole function of a proper government is protection of individual rights (including [[property right]]s).

She believed that individuals should choose their values and actions solely by reason. According to Rand, the individual &quot;must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Voice of Reason | first = Ayn | last = Rand | publisher = Dutton Plume (1989)}} &quot;Introducing Objectivism&quot; p. ''3''. This article originally appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' on June 17, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because she held that [[faith]] is antithetical to reason, Rand opposed religion.

Rand considered the [[initiation of force]] or fraud to be immoral, and held that government action should consist only in protecting citizens from criminal aggression (via the police), foreign aggression (via the military), and in maintaining a system of courts to decide guilt or innocence for objectively defined crimes and to resolve disputes. Her politics are generally described as [[minarchism|minarchist]] and [[libertarian]], though she did not use the first term and disavowed any connection to the second.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_libertarians|title=&quot;Ayn Rand's Q&amp;A on Libertarians.&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-22}} at the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. Rand stated in 1980, &quot;I've read nothing by a Libertarian ... that wasn't my ideas badly mishandled—i.e., had the teeth pulled out of them—with no credit given.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand, a self-described hero-worshiper, stated in her book ''[[The Romantic Manifesto]]'' that the goal of her writing was &quot;the projection of an ideal man.&quot; In reference to her philosophy, Objectivism, she said: &quot;My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rand | first = Ayn | title = Atlas Shrugged| publisher = [[Random House]] | location = New York | year = 1957 | isbn = 0394415760 |chapter=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was greatly influenced by [[Aristotle]] and found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (although she later firmly rejected his approach). She was vociferously opposed to some of the views of [[Immanuel Kant]], particularly those claiming the impotence of reason. She also had an intellectual kinship with [[John Locke]], who conceived the ideas that individuals have a right to the products of their own labor and have [[natural rights]] to life, liberty, and property,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.mondopolitico.com/ideologies/atlantis/whatisobjectivism.htm|title=&quot;What is objectivism?&quot;|accessdate=2006-04-10}}. Refers to a Leonard Peikoff lecture describing the connection between Rand and [[John Locke]]'s [[Two Treatises of Government]] (1689).&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally with the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Age of Reason]]. She occasionally reported her approval of specific philosophical positions, including some of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].

==Objectivist movement==
{{Main|Objectivist movement}}
In 1950 Rand moved to 120 East 34th Street&lt;ref&gt; Branden, Nathaniel. {{cite web|title=&quot;Devers Branden and Ayn Rand.&quot;|url=http://rous.redbarn.org/objectivism/writing/NathanielBranden/DeversAndAyn.html|accessdate=2006-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]], and formed a group (jokingly designated &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot;) which included future [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and [[Leonard Peikoff]], all of whom had been profoundly influenced by ''The Fountainhead.'' According to Branden, &quot;I wrote Miss Rand a letter in 1949 ... [and] I was invited to her home for a personal meeting in March, 1950, a month before I turned twenty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/rand.php#|title=Nathaniel Branden discusses his relationship with Rand.|date=[[2006-03-23]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand launched the [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivist]] movement with this group to promote her philosophy.

The group originally started out as an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy; later the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, helping edit ''Atlas Shrugged'' and promoting Rand's philosophy through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), established by him for that purpose. Many Collective members gave lectures at the NBI and in cities across the United States, while others wrote articles for its sister newsletter, ''[[The Objectivist]].'' Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through both her fiction and non-fiction works, and by giving talks at several east-coast universities, largely through the NBI. &quot;''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]],'' later expanded and renamed simply ''The Objectivist,'' contained essays by Rand, Branden, and other associates ... that analyzed current political events and applied the principles of Objectivism to everyday life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JVL&quot;/&gt; Rand later published some of these in book form.

After several years, Rand's close relationship with the much younger Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/biofaq.html#Q4.4 | title=&quot;Ayn Rand Biographical FAQ: Did Rand have an affair with Nathaniel Branden?&quot; | accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted until Branden (having separated from Barbara) entered into an affair with the young actress [[Patrecia Scott]], whom he later married. The Brandens hid the affair from Rand, and when she found out, she abruptly ended her relationship with both Brandens and with the NBI, which closed. She published a letter in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Branden for dishonesty and &quot;irrational behavior&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;thimc&quot;&gt;Rand, Ayn. To whom it may concern. ''The Objectivist,'' v. 7, no. 5, pp. 1-8, New York 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; never disclosing their affair. Both Brandens remain ''[[persona non grata|personae non gratae]]'' to the mainline Objectivist movement, particularly the group that formed the [[Ayn Rand Institute]].

Several prominent critics of the movement accused it of being a [[cult]],&lt;ref&gt;*[[Murray Rothbard]] (who helped define modern [[libertarianism]] and [[anarcho-capitalism]]) in Rothbard, Murray. {{cite web|title=&quot;The sociology of the Ayn Rand cult.&quot;|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html|accessdate=2006-03-31}} * Jeff Walker, in Walker, Jeff (1999). ''The Ayn Rand Cult''. Chicago: Open Court. ISBN 0-8126-9390-6 * [[Michael Shermer]] (founder of [[The Skeptics Society]]),in Shermer, Michael. {{cite web|title=&quot;The Unlikeliest Cult in History&quot;|url=http://www.2think.org/02_2_she.shtml|accessdate=2006-03-30}} Originally published in ''Skeptic'' vol. 2, no. 2, 1993, pp. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that it exhibited typical cult traits, including slavish adherence to unprovable doctrine and extreme adulation of the founder. Objectivists counter that even if some of Rand's followers have acted like cultists, this was not intended by Rand, and note that Rand explicitly condemned &quot;blind followers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''Letters'', p. 592 Letter dated December 10, 1961, Plume (1997), ISBN 0-452-27404-4, as cited in {{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Biographical FAQ: Did Rand organize a cult?&quot;|url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/biofaq.html#Q3.3|accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social views==
Rand held that the only moral social system is ''laissez-faire'' capitalism. Her political views were strongly [[individualist]] and hence [[anti-statist]] and [[anti-Communist]]. She exalted what she saw as the heroic [[American values]] of [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]]. As a champion of rationality, Rand also had a strong opposition to [[mysticism]] and religion, which she believed helped foster a crippling culture acting against individual human happiness and success. Rand detested many prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[American conservatism|conservative]] politicians of her time, including prominent anti-Communists, such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Hubert Humphrey]], and [[Joseph McCarthy]].

Many consider Rand one of the three founding mothers (along with [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]]) of modern American [[libertarianism]], although she rejected libertarianism and the [[libertarian movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=&quot;Three Women Who Inspired the Modern Libertarian Movement&quot; | url=http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=3345 | accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars===
While Rand often criticized conventional motivations for U.S. involvement in [[World War I]], [[World War II]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;&gt; {{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand on WWII&quot;|url=http://ariwatch.com/AynRandOnWWII.htm|accessdate=2006-04-07}} Excerpts from Rand's writing, cited at the ARI Watch website.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Korean War]], she approved American action when strictly justified in response to an attack, as in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Journals of Ayn Rand | first = Ayn | last = Rand | publisher = Dutton (1997)}} Edited by David Harriman. p.''315''.&lt;/ref&gt;  She strongly denounced [[pacifism]]: &quot;When a nation resorts to war, it has some purpose, rightly or wrongly, something to fight for—and the only justifiable purpose is self-defense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;honoringvirtue&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url=http://ariwatch.com/HonoringVirtue.htm|title=&quot;Honoring Virtue&quot;|accessdate=2006-04-06}} at the ARI website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand opposed the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;honoringvirtue&quot;/&gt; but also believed that unilateral American withdrawal would be a mistake of [[appeasement]] that would embolden communists and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;/&gt;

Rand supported [[Israel]] during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|Arab-Israeli War]], which she saw as an attack by a primitive society on a government that largely supported individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand [[Ford Hall Forum]] lecture, 1974, text published on the website of [[The Ayn Rand Institute]] [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_america_at_war_israeli_arab_conflict]&lt;/ref&gt;  While Rand characterized Israel as &quot;a mixed economy inclined toward socialism,&quot; this was secondary to the consideration that &quot;when it comes to the power of the mind—the development of industry in that wasted desert continent—versus savages who don't want to use their minds, then if one cares about the future of civilization, don't wait for the government to do something. Give whatever you can&quot;.

===Economics===
Rand expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Henry Hazlitt]], and The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] notes that &quot;it was largely as a result of Ayn's efforts that the work of von Mises began to reach its potential audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick T. Long|Long, Roderick T.]] {{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/fullstory.aspx?Id=1738|title=&quot;Ayn Rand's Contributions to the Cause of Freedom.&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-26}} Long also cites Barbara Branden's ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'' as the source for this claim.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Objectivists, such as [[Richard Salsman]], have claimed that Rand's economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], though Rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===Charity===
Rand did not see [[charity]] as a moral duty or a major virtue and held it to be proper only when the recipient is worthy and when it does not involve sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=faq_index#obj_q7 The Ayn Rand Institute: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed all forms of aid given by governments, just as she opposed any other government activity not directed at protecting individual rights.

===Gender and sex===

Rand's views on [[gender role]] are controversial. While her books champion men and women as intellectual equals, she thought that physiological differences between the sexes led to fundamental psychological differences that were the source of gender roles. Rand denied endorsing any kind of power difference between men and women, stating that metaphysical dominance in sexual relations refers to the man's role as the prime mover in sex and the necessity of male arousal for sex to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayn Rand Answers&quot;&gt;Rand, Ayn. Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q and A, (2006) ISBN 0451216652 &lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, &quot;For a woman ''qua'' woman, the essence of femininity is hero-worship—the desire to look up to man.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;iijwxo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rand, Ayn | title=An Answer to Readers (about a Woman President) | journal=The Objectivist | year=1968 | volume=7 | issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that sex in its highest form is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values, a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.

In a [[McCall's]] magazine interview, Rand stated that while women are competent to be President, no rational woman should seek that position; she later explained that it would be psychologically damaging to the woman.&lt;ref name = &quot;iijwxo&quot;/&gt; She strongly opposed the modern [[feminist]] movement, despite supporting some of its goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;new left&quot;&gt;Rand, Ayn. The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution, (1993) ISBN 0-452-01125-6&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist author [[Susan Brownmiller]] called Rand &quot;a traitor to her own sex,&quot; while others, including [[Camille Paglia]] and the contributors to 1999's ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand,'' have noted Rand's &quot;fiercely independent—and unapologetically sexual&quot; heroines who are unbound by &quot;tradition's chains ... [and] who had sex because they wanted to.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLemee&quot;&gt; McLemee, Scott. {{cite web|title=&quot;The Heirs of Ayn Rand.&quot;|url=http://www.mclemee.com/id39.html|accessdate=2006-04-03}} originally in ''Lingua Franca'', September 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Rand's fiction features sex scenes with stylized erotic combat that some claim borders on [[rape]]. Rand said that if what ''The Fountainhead'' depicted was rape it was &quot;rape by engraved invitation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Barbara. ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', Doubleday (1986) ISBN 0385191715, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of a biography of Rand, writer Jenny Turner opined, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;the sex in Rand’s novels is extraordinarily violent and fetishistic. In ''The Fountainhead,'' the first coupling of the heroes, heralded by whips and rock drills and horseback riding and cracks in marble, is ‘an act of scorn ... not as love, but as defilement’—in other words, a rape... In ''Atlas Shrugged,'' erotic tension is cleverly increased by having one heroine bound into a plot with lots of spectacularly cruel and handsome men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{seealso|Objectivism, Ayn Rand, and homosexuality}}

Another source of controversy is Rand's view of [[homosexuality]]. Asked at the [[Ford Hall Forum]] at [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in 1971 about her position, Rand stated that homosexuality is &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford&quot;&gt; Ford Hall forum remarks, cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/biofaq.html#Q5.2.6|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Biographical FAQ: Ayn Rand and Homosexuality&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, she stated that &quot;there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality&quot; because &quot;it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/biofaq-notes.html#n5.2.6-1|title=Notes, The Ayn Rand Biographical FAQ|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of noted current and former Objectivists have been highly critical of Rand for her views on homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Varnell, Paul. {{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand and Homosexuality&quot;|url=http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/varnell/varnell118.html|accessdate=2007-10-06}} at the Indegay Forum, originally published in the Chicago Free Press December 3, 2003. &lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Kurt Keefner, have argued that &quot;Rand’s views were in line with the views at the time of the general public and the psychiatric community,&quot; though he asserts that &quot;she never provided the slightest argument for her position, ... because she regarded the matter as self-evident, like the woman president issue,&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Keefner, Kurt. {{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/homo/atlasphere.htm|title=&quot;Sciabarra on Ayn Rand and Homosexuality&quot;|date=[[2006-03-24]]}} A review of Chris Matthew Sciabarra’s ''Ayn Rand, Homosexuality, and Human Liberation ''(2003, Leap Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt; (although in her article &quot;About a Woman President&quot; Rand said that that issue was ''not'' self-evident).

In the same appearance, Rand noted, &quot;I do not believe that the government has the right to prohibit [[homosexual behavior]]. It is the privilege of any individual to use his sex life in whichever way he wants it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford&quot;/&gt;

In her novels Rand often depicted men who intensely love each other, although that love has no sexual expression—for example, the relationship of [[Howard Roark]] and [[Gail Wynand]] in &quot;[[The Fountainhead]]&quot;.

===Race===

Rand opposed ethnic and racial prejudice on moral grounds, in essays like &quot;Racism&quot; and &quot;Global [[Balkanization]],&quot; while still arguing for the right of individuals and businesses to act on such prejudice without government intervention. She wrote, &quot;[[Racism]] is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of [[collectivism]] ... [the notion] that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors,&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Rand, Ayn. &quot;Racism,&quot; in ''Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution'' ISBN 0-452-01184-1, p. 179, at {{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_topic_racism_and_diversity|title=The Ayn Rand Institute|accessdate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but opposed governmental remedies for this problem: &quot;Private racism is not a legal, but a moral issue—and can be fought only by private means, such as economic [[boycott]] or social ostracism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Racism,&quot; in ''Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution'', p. 182 &lt;/ref&gt;

===HUAC testimony===
{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the [[United States]] [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony regarded the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the fanciful portrayal of it in the 1943 film ''[[Song of Russia]].'' Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union and portrayed life in the USSR as being much better than it actually was. Furthermore, she believed that even if a temporary alliance with the USSR was necessary to defeat the Nazis, the case for this should not have been made by portraying what she believed were falsely positive images of Soviet life:

{{bquote|If we had good reason, if that is what you believe, all right, then why not tell the truth? Say it is a dictatorship, but we want to be associated with it. Say it is worthwhile being associated with the devil, as Churchill said, in order to defeat another evil which is Hitler. There might be some good argument made for that. But why pretend that Russia was not what it was?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HUAC&quot;&gt;Rand's HUAC testimony, cited at {{cite web|url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/huac.html|title=The Objectivism Reference Center|accessdate=2006-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the hearings, when Rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations, she described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUAC&quot;/&gt;

==Later years==
===Visiting lecturer===
Beginning in 1960, Rand was a visiting lecturer at several universities such as [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Columbia University]]. In subsequent years, she went on to lecture at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand's Bibliography {{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand's Bibliography&quot;|url=http://festivals.iloveindia.com/teachers-day/famous-teachers/ayn-rand.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Timeline of Ayn Rand's Life and Career&quot;|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_aynrand_timeline|accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, she gave an annual lecture at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], answering questions from the audience afterward.

===Declining health and death===
[[Image:Ayn Rand Marker.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grave marker of [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]] and Ayn Rand.]]In 1973, she was briefly reunited with her youngest sister, Nora, who still lived in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;JVL&quot;&gt;Daligga, Catherine. {{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Rand.html|title=&quot;Ayn Rand&quot; Biography at the Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rand had written 1,200 letters to her family in the Soviet Union, and had attempted to bring them to the United States, she had ceased contacting them in 1937 after reading a notice in the post office that letters from Americans might imperil Russians at risk from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=7581|title=&quot;Ayn Rand's Sister: Eleanora Drobyshev 1910-1999&quot;|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand received a letter from Nora in 1973 and invited her and her husband to America; but her sister's views had changed, and to Rand's disappointment Nora voluntarily returned to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=7581|title=&quot;Ayn Rand's Sister: Eleanora Drobyshev 1910-1999&quot;|accessdate=2006-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974, and conflicts continued in the wake of the break with Branden and the subsequent collapse of the NBI. Many of her closest &quot;Collective&quot; friends parted company, and during the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.&lt;ref&gt; ARI, {{cite web|title=&quot;Timeline of Ayn Rand's Life and Career.&quot;|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_aynrand_timeline|accessdate=2006-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged.'' She had also planned to write another novel, ''To Lorne Dieterling,'' but did not get far in her notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Journals of Ayn Rand | first = Ayn | last = Rand | publisher = Dutton (1997)}} Edited by David Harriman. p.''697''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982 at her 34th Street home in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt; Saxon, Wolfgang. {{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/obituaries/07randobit.html|title=&quot;Ayn Rand, 'Fountainhead' Author, Dies.&quot;|accessdate=2008-02-02}} ''The New York Times,'' March 7, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; years after having successfully battled cancer, and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]]. 
Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiendecker&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Ayn Rand quote, American Adventure, Epcot Center, Walt Disney World.jpg.jpg|thumb|right|A quote from Rand's book ''The Fountainhead'', featured in an American Adventure exhibit in [[Epcot]], [[Walt Disney World]]]]
After decades of dismissal or outright hostility from the profession, Rand's ideas have found some prominent, if still quite limited, recognition within academic philosophy.  At least two universities (Clemson and The University of Texas at Austin) have established chairs or centers which explicitly revolve around her views. Her books continue to be widely sold and read, with 25 million copies sold (as of 2007), and 800,000 more being sold each year.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand Institute, {{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Institute: Sales of Ayn Rand Books Reach 25 million Copies&quot;|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17345&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1221|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following Rand's death, continued conflict within the Objectivist movement led to establishment of independent organizations claiming to be her intellectual heirs.

===Ayn Rand Institute===
{{main|Ayn Rand Institute}}

In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]], a surviving member of &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot; and Ayn Rand's designated heir, established &quot;The [[Ayn Rand Institute]]: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism&quot; (ARI). The Ayn Rand Institute &quot;works to introduce young people to Ayn Rand's novels, to support scholarship and research based on her ideas, and to promote the principles of reason, rational self-interest, individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism to the widest possible audience.&quot;

===The Objectivist Center and The Atlas Society===
{{main|The Atlas Society}}

Another schism in the movement occurred in 1989, when Objectivist [[David Kelley]] wrote &quot;A Question of Sanction,&quot; in which he defended his choice to speak to non-Objectivist [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups: &quot;It was a response to an article by [[Peter Schwartz]] in The Intellectual Activist, demanding that those who speak to libertarians be ostracized from the movement...[I] observed that Objectivism is not a closed system of belief; and that we might actually learn something by talking to people we disagree with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, David. {{cite web|url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=39&amp;h=51|title=&quot;Introduction to 'The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand'&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley's description of the reasons behind the break is disputed by the Ayn Rand Institute. Peikoff, in an article for ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]'' called &quot;Fact and Value&quot; argued that Objectivism is, indeed, a closed system, and that truth and morality are directly related.&lt;ref name=&quot;factandvalue&quot;&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. {{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_f-v|title=&quot;Fact and Value.&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff expelled Kelley from his organization, whereupon Kelley founded The Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]], which has its own web site that is focused on attracting readers of Ayn Rand's fiction. The associated Objectivist Center division deals with more academic ventures. The Atlas Society/Objectivist Center also publishes ''The New Individualist'' (formerly ''Navigator'').

===Popular interest and influence===
[[Image:Fountainhead cafe.jpg|thumb|The Fountainhead Cafe, a coffee shop in [[New York City]] inspired by Objectivism. The sign reads &quot;Eat Objectively, Live Rich&quot;.]]
Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, she has a growing international following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/worldwide/story/0,9959,615157,00.html | title=A Growing Concern | accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books were international best sellers, and they continue to sell in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3661 | title=Ayn Rand at 100 | author=David Boaz | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Atlas Shrugged'' is consistently in the top few hundred best sellers at Amazon.com;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0452011876 | title=Atlas Shrugged (Paperback) | author=Amazon.com | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 185,000 copies were sold in 2007, fifty years after it was first published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17225 | title=Sales of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; at All-Time Record | accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in a 1991 survey by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] what the most influential book in the respondent's life was, Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged'' was the second most popular choice, after the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D0CE7D61339F933A15752C1A967958260|title= Book Notes|author=Fein, Esther B|date=1991-11-20|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers polled in 1998 and 1999 by Modern Library placed four of her books on the 100 Best Novels list (''Atlas Shrugged'', ''The Fountainhead'', [[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]], and ''We the Living'' were in first, second, seventh, and eighth place, respectively) and one on the 100 Best Nonfiction list ([[The Virtue of Selfishness]], in first place), with books about Rand and her philosophy in third and sixth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100best.html|title=&quot;The Modern Library: 100 Best&quot;|date=[[2007-11-02]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the validity of such polls has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/literature-millennial-lists | title=Literature and Millennial Lists | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.objectivistliving.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t4262.html | title=Atlas Shrugged FAQ: 6.4 Is it true that ''Atlas Shrugged'' is the second most influential book ever written? | author=Richard Lawrence | accessdate=2008-02-01}} Observes that the Modern Library poll did not conduct random sampling and allowed voting multiple times.&lt;/ref&gt; A Freestar Media/Zogby poll conducted in 2007 found that 8.1% percent of American adults have read ''Atlas Shrugged'', with a [[margin of error]] of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freestarmedia.com/randpoll2007.html | title=&quot;Zogby Poll: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand Read by 8.1%&quot; | date=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable individuals have acknowledged that Rand significantly influenced their lives, including: [[Bob Barr]], [[Sinan Çetin]], [[Roy A. Childs]], [[James Clavell]], [[Edward Cline]], [[Chris Cox]], [[Mark Cuban]], [[Paul DePodesta]], [[Steve Ditko]], [[Terry Goodkind]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Erika Holzer]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Anton LaVey]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Mike Mentzer]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Neil Peart]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Tracey Ross]], [[Kay Nolte Smith]], [[John Stossel]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Jimmy Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The New Individualist|issue=Jan/Feb|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's philosophy of Objectivism continues to influence workers in the arts, business, and science.

''[[BioShock]]'', an award-winning [[video game]] released in the summer of 2007, is built around a story influenced by Rand's philosophy and ''Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-09/pl_games  |title=First-Person Shooter ''BioShock'' Owes More to Ayn Rand Than Doom |accessdate=2008-01-18 |last=Gillen |first=Kieron |coauthors= |date=[[2008-08-23]] |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rand's work and academic philosophy===

During Rand's lifetime her work was not given much attention by academic philosophers, and currently only a few universities consider Rand or Objectivism to be a philosophical specialty or research area. Many adherents and practitioners of [[continental philosophy]] criticize her celebration of self-interest, and as a result there has been little focus on her work in this intellectual discipline. However, since her death in 1982, there has been an increase in academic interest in Ayn Rand's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat|name=Ayn Rand|id=lccn-n50-54463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 interview in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra said, &quot;I know they laugh at Rand,&quot; while also noting a growing interest in her work in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;Sharlet, Jeff.{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/colloquy/99/rand/background.htm|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Has Finally Caught the Attention of Scholars&quot;|accessdate=2006-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellowships for the study of Ayn Rand's ideas have been established by the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship at academic institutions such as the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/01newsreleases/nr_200110/nr_fellowship011016.html|title=''UT Texas Press Release''|accessdate=2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses of the Ayn Rand Institute's [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_oac_faq Objectivist Academic Center] now earn university credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Journal of Ayn Rand Studies ''(JARS), a self-described &quot;nonpartisan&quot; peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Ayn Rand—principally her philosophic work—is published twice yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/reviews.asp|title=''Journal of Ayn Rand Studies''|accessdate=2006-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ayn Rand Society, founded in 1987 and affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]], has been active in sponsoring seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org/|title=''Ayn Rand Society''|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2006 conference at the University of Pittsburgh, &quot;Concepts and Objectivity: Knowledge, Science, and Values,&quot; featured presentations by Objectivists Onkar Ghate, [[Allan Gotthelf]], James Lennox, and Darryl Wright alongside non-Objectivist academics such as A.P. Martinich and [[Peter Railton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pitt.edu/~hpsdept/news/news/ConceptsObjConf2006.pdf|format=pdf | title=''Concepts and Objectivity: Knowledge, Science, and Values'' | accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Cambridge University Press]] published ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory written by ARI-affiliated scholar [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], a philosophy professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. A review of Smith's book by Helen Cullyer of the University of Pittsburgh, published in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', ends with the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It should be stressed in conclusion that whether one is a fan or a detractor of Ayn Rand, the issues raised by this book are manifold and provocative. This book should force a debate of renewed vigor about what we mean by egoism, whether and how the egoism/altruism dichotomy should be applied within eudaemonistic ethical theories, and what our ethical theories imply about our political outlook. Smith provides us with a version of egoism that will need to be argued against by those who find it distasteful or misguided, rather than simply dismissed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=8123 Review of Tara Smith's ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: the Virtuous Egoist'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Student activism===
Objectivism has remained popular on college campuses, with dozens of student groups dedicated to promoting and studying the philosophy of Objectivism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Institute Campus Clubs&quot;|url= http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_findclubs| /=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;TOC Ayn Rand Clubs&quot;|url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-15-1448-Local_Clubs.aspx|accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Meetup.com Ayn Rand Groups&quot;|url= http://aynrand.meetup.com/about/|accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; spread across the U.S., Australia, Canada, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;UK Guardian: A growing concern&quot;|url= http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/worldwide/story/0,9959,615157,00.html|accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs often present controversial speakers on topics such as abortion, religion, and foreign policy, often allying with controversial conservative (and sometimes liberal) organizations to organize their events. For example the NYU Objectivism Club hosted a joint panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;NYU Panel Commentary&quot;|url= http://nyu.objectivismonline.net/content/view/16/9/|accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons|Muhammad cartoons]] that received nationwide coverage for NYU's censorship of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Inside Higher Education&quot;|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/30/cartoon |accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several dozen speakers sponsored by the Ayn Rand Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Ayn Rand Institute Speaker List&quot;|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_speakers_writers |accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations who give nationwide tours each year speaking about Objectivism.

The [[Ayn Rand Institute]] has spent more than $5M on educational programs advancing Objectivism, including scholarships and clubs. These clubs often obtain educational materials and speakers from the ARI. The [http://www.objectivistclubs.org/ Objectivist Club Association] and [http://www.objectivismonline.net/ ObjectivismOnline] provide free hosting and organizational resources for Objectivist clubs. There are also several conferences organized by various organizations, such as the [http://www.objectivistconferences.com/ Objectivist Conferences], which draw several hundred attendees each summer and feature philosophy courses and presentations of new publications and research.

==Criticism==
===Philosophical criticism===
{{main|Criticism of Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Rand's ideas, and ''Atlas Shrugged'' in particular, as sophomoric, preachy, and unoriginal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A notable exception to the general lack of attention paid to Rand in academic philosophy is the essay &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by [[Harvard University]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], which appears in his collection, ''Socratic Puzzles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Socratic Puzzles | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0674816544 |chapter=On the Randian Argument}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick is sympathetic to Rand's political conclusions, but does not think her arguments justify them. In particular, his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics—laid out most explicitly in her book ''The Virtue of Selfishness''—which claims that one's own life is, for each individual, the ultimate value because it makes all other values possible. Nozick says that to make this argument sound one needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and thus having no values. Therefore, he argues, her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of [[begging the question]]. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory.{{context needed}} [[Tara Smith]] responds to this criticism in her book ''Viable Values.''{{page number}}

Rand has also been accused of misinterpreting the works of many of the philosophers that she criticized in her writing. According to Fred Seddon, author of ''Ayn Rand, Objectivists, and the History of Philosophy'' (2003), Nathaniel Branden has stated that Rand never read any of Kant's works.&lt;ref&gt;Seddon, Fred. ''Ayn Rand, Objectivists, and the History of Philosophy'', University Press of America (2003), ISBN 0-7618-2308-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary criticism===
Rand's novels, when they were first published, &quot;received almost unanimously terrible reviews&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot; /&gt; and were derided by some critics as long and melodramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Steve{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20050201-094832-2692r.htm|title=''The evolution of Ayn Rand''|accessdate=2006-04-09}} ''The Washington Times,'' February 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they became bestsellers due largely to word of mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot; /&gt; Scholars of English and American [[literature]] have largely ignored her work, although Rand has received occasional positive reviews from the literary establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S., ''Letters of Ayn Rand'' (New York: Plume, 1995), pp. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; For example,   in the ''Literary Encyclopedia'' John Lewis of Ashland University calls her works &quot;the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John, {{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3705|title=Literary Encyclopedia:Ayn Rand|accessdate=2007-11-26}}, October 20, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most famous review of Rand's novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was written by the conservative author [[Whittaker Chambers]] and appeared in ''[[National Review]]'' in 1957. It was unrelentingly scathing. Chambers called the book &quot;sophomoric&quot;; and &quot;remarkably silly,&quot; and said it &quot;can be called a novel only by devaluing the term.&quot; He described the tone of the book as &quot;shrillness without reprieve.&quot; Chambers accused Rand of supporting the same godless system as the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]], claiming &quot;From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To the gas chambers—go!'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname=Chambers | given=Whittaker | authorlink=Whittaker Chambers | title=Big Sister is Watching You | journal=National Review | year=1957 | pages=594–596 | url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles2/ChambersAynRand.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five decades later, ''The Intellectual Activist'' published a reply, arguing that Chambers had not actually read the book, as he misspelled the names of two major characters and used no quotations from the novel in his critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?id=4081 A Half-Century-Old Attack on Ayn Rand Reminds Us of the Dark Side of Conservatism by Robert W. Tracinski—Capitalism Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critic, Mimi Gladstein (author of ''The New Ayn Rand Companion''), called Rand's characters flat and uninteresting, and her heroes implausibly wealthy, intelligent, physically attractive and free of doubt while arrayed against antagonists who are weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand | first = Mimi R. | last = Gladstein |coauthor = Chris Matthew Sciabarra | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | year = 1999 | id = ISBN 0-271-01831-3 }} p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand stated in a 1963 essay, titled &quot;The Goal of My Writing&quot;, that her fiction was intentionally different in that its goal was to project a vision of an ideal man: not man as he is, but man as he might be and ought to be. Rand, who described herself as a [[romantic realism|&quot;romantic realist&quot;]], presented her theory of aesthetics more fully in her 1969 book, ''The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature''.

They were nearly censored by the [[Italy|Italian]] government under [[Benito Mussolini]], but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti-Soviet. The films were successful, and the public easily realized that they were as much against Fascism as Communism. These films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.

''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041386/|title=The Fountainhead (1949), at the IMDB|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hollywood]] film (1949, Warner Bros.) starring [[Gary Cooper]], for which Rand wrote the screen-play. Rand initially insisted that [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] design the architectural models used in the film, but relented when his fee was too high.&lt;ref&gt; Skousen, after [[Barbara Branden]] ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'' ISBN 0-385-19171-5 &lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Atlas Shrugged (film)|film adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged'']] is in pre-production as of early 2008, with production possibly starting in December if the script can be revised in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=43995|title=''Atlas Shrugged'' Moves Forward|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Lions Gate Films reported that it had hired [[Vadim Perelman]] to revise [[Randall Wallace]]'s script and to direct the film, with screen star [[Angelina Jolie]] cast in the role of Dagny Taggart.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117971319.html|title=Vadim Perelman to direct 'Atlas'|accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jolie's 2008 pregnancy and Perelman's departure have cast the project into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0247628/ Jolie Fears She's Missed Out On Atlas Film With Pitt], Imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140447/|title=The Passion of Ayn Rand (1999), at the IMDB|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent film about her life, was made in 1999, starring [[Helen Mirren]] as Ayn Rand, [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Julie Delpy]] and [[Peter Fonda]]. The film was based on the book by [[Barbara Branden]], one of her former associates, and won several awards including an Emmy for Helen Mirren and a Golden Globe for Peter Fonda.

===Screenplays===
In addition to the screenplay of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand also collaborated on screenplays of ''You Came Along'' and ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' both filmed in 1945.

'''Alain Connes''' (born 1 April 1947) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[College de France]], [[IHÉS]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. 

==Work==
Alain Connes is one of the leading specialists on [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the 
[[Baum-Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry| noncommutative differential geometry]].

Connes has applied his work in areas of [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (April 3, 1885 &amp;ndash; December 28, 1981) was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[film|motion picture]] [[film director|director]], producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], his family moved to the United States when he was 11 years old. At the University of Notre Dame, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in [[Chicago]]. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in [[California]] where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part time in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. While still in [[New York]], in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

==Career==
After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over 50 years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

'''Algeria''' ('''{{lang|ar|[[Arabic]] الجزائر}}''', ''Al Jaza'ir'' {{IPA2|ælʤæˈzæːʔir}}, [[Amazigh languages|Amazigh]]: ⴷⵥⴰⵢⴻⵔ, ''Dzayer''  {{IPA|[ˈdzæjər]}}), officially the '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''', is a country located in [[North Africa]]. It is the largest country of the Mediterranean sea, the second largest on the African continent&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; and the eleventh-largest country in the world in terms of land area.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta MSN&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by [[Tunisia]] in the northeast, [[Libya]] in the east, [[Niger]] in the southeast, [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]] in the southwest, a few kilometers of the [[Western Sahara]] in the west, [[Morocco]] in the northwest, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north.

Algeria is a member of the [[Arab League]], [[United Nations]], [[African Union]] and [[OPEC]]. It also contributed towards the creation of the [[Arab Maghreb Union|Arab Maghreb Union]].

== Etymology == 
''Al-jazā’ir'' is itself a truncated form of the city's older name of '''jazā’ir banī mazghannā''', Arabic for &quot;the islands of (the tribe) Ait Mazghanna&quot;, used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

=== Ancient history ===
[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]

Algeria has been inhabited by Berbers since at least [[10,000 BC]], after 1000 BC, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] began establishing settlements along the coast. The Berbers seized the opportunity offered by the [[Punic Wars]] to become independent of Carthage, and Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably [[Numidia]]. In 200 BC, however, they were once again taken over, this time by the [[Roman Republic]]. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed, Berbers became independent again in many areas, while the [[Vandals]] took control over other parts, where they remained until expelled by the generals of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the Arabs in the eighth century.

=== Middle Ages ===
According to historians of the Middle Ages, the Berbers were divided into two branches, from their ancestor Mazigh. The two branches, Botr and Barnès, were also divided into tribes, with each [[Maghreb]] region made up of several tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale De Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://books.google.fr/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=in+khaldoun#PPR15,M1&lt;/ref&gt; Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.fr/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115&amp;dq=ibn+khaldoun#PPR10,M1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale De Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]]s were able to unify the Maghreb. The Berbers of the Middle Ages also contributed to the Arabization of the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;Les langues de la Méditerranée De Robert Bistolfi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab Migration and the Arrival of Islam ===
[[Image:Grande mosquée d'Alger.jpg|thumb|left]] 
After the waves of Muslim Arab armies that conquered Algeria from it's former Berber rulers and the rule of the Umayyid Arab Dynasty fell, numerous Dynasties emerged thereafter.  Amongst those dynasties are the Fatimids of Egypt. Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the [[Rustamid]]s, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals. When the latter rebelled and adopted [[Sunni]]sm, the Shia Fatimids sent in the [[Banu Hilal]], a populous Arab tribe, to weaken them. This continued the [[Arabization]] of the region since numerous other tribes then migrated with the Banu Hilal such as Banu Sulaym, Banu Muqal, Banu Jashm, and Banu Khalt &lt;ref&gt;History of Ibn Khaldun&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his Muqiddimah/Prolegomena, Ibn Khaldun sheds light on the Arab immigration into the Maghreb: &quot;at the end of the eighth [fourteenth] century-the situation in the Maghrib, as we can observe, has taken a turn and changed entirely. The Berbers, the original population of the Maghrib, have been replaced by an influx of Arabs, (that began in) the fifth [eleventh] century. The Arabs outnumbered and overpowered the Berbers, stripped them of most of their lands, and (also) obtained a share of those that remained in their possession as, in the middle of the eighth [fourteenth] century, civilization both in the East and the West was visited by a destructive plague which devastated nations and caused populations to vanish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldun / Prolegomena&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman rule===
Algeria was made part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by [[Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa]] and his brother [[Oruç Reis|Aruj]] in 1517.  They established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Barbary pirate|Ottoman corsairs]]; their [[privateer]]ing peaking in [[Algiers]] in the 1600s. Piracy on [[United States|American]] vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]] (1815) with the United States. The piracy acts forced people captured on the boats into [[slavery]]; alternatively when the pirates attacked coastal villages in southern and western Europe the inhabitants were forced into [[Arab slave trade|slavery]].[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html Barbary Pirates — Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911]
[[Image:MoorishAmbassador to Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|The Moorish ambassador of the Barbary States to the Court of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]].]]
The '''Barbary pirates''', also sometimes called '''[[History of the Turkish Navy#Famous admirals|Ottoman corsairs]]''' or the Marine Jihad (الجهاد البحري), were Muslim [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s that operated from [[North Africa]], from the time of the [[Crusades]] until the early 19th century. Based in North African ports such as [[Tunis]] in Tunisia, [[Tripoli]] in Libya, [[Algiers]] in Algeria, [[Salé]] and other ports in [[Morocco]], they preyed on [[Christian]] and other non-[[Islam]]ic shipping in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Their stronghold was along the stretch of northern Africa known as the [[Barbary Coast]] (a medieval term for the [[Maghreb]] after its [[Berber people|Berber]] inhabitants), but their predation was said to extend throughout the Mediterranean, south along [[West Africa]]'s [[Atlantic]] seaboard, and into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] as far north as [[Iceland]] and the [[United States]]. They often made raids, called ''[[Razzia]]s'', on European coastal towns to capture Christian [[slavery|slaves]] to sell at [[Islam and slavery#Oriental slave trade|slave markets]] in places such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Algeria]] and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million [[Europe]]ans as slaves. These slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and from farther places like [[France]] or [[England]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]] and even Iceland, [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]] and North America. 

The impact of these [[List of Ottoman sieges and landings|attacks]] was devastating – France, England, and [[Spain]] each lost thousands of ships, and long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. Pirate raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century.

The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman ''[[Barbarossa]]'' (&quot;Redbeard&quot;) brothers — [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin (Hızır)]] and his older brother [[Oruç Reis]] — who took control of Algiers in the early 16th century and turned it into the centre of Mediterranean piracy and privateering for three centuries, as well as establishing the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s presence in [[North Africa]] which lasted four centuries. Other famous Ottoman privateer-admirals included [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West), [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Kurtoğlu]] (known as [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Curtogoli]] in the West), [[Kemal Reis]], [[Salih Reis]], [[Nemdil Reis]] and [[Murat Reis the Older|Koca Murat Reis]].

[[Image:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|right|thumb|[[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]].]]
In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/09/26/trsic_ed3_.php |title=The mysteries and majesties of the Aeolian Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island [[Gozo]], between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to [[Libya]]. In 1554, pirates sacked [[Vieste]] in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centrovacanzeoriente.it/cvoriente/en/dintorni.jsp |title=Vieste}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, Turgut Reis sacked [[Bastia]], [[Corsica]], taking 6000 prisoners.

{{main|French rule in Algeria}}
On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[France|French]] invaded [[Algiers]] in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |pages=29–30 |isbn=1-59017-218-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Algeria by the [[France|French]] was long and particularly violent, and it resulted in the disappearance of about a third of the Algerian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103772b http://gallica.bnf.fr/], La démographie figurée de l'Algérie, op.cit., p.260 et 261.&lt;/ref&gt; France was responsible for the extermination of 1 million Algerians. According to [[Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison]], the [[France|French]] pursued a policy of extermination against the Algerians.

The [[France|French]] conquest of Algeria was slow due to intense resistance from such people as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]]. Indeed, the conquest was not technically complete until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered.

[[Image:Mairie d oran.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Oran, Algeria]]
Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1958. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Spain, [[Italy]], and [[Malta]] moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupied significant parts of Algeria's cities. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |pages=32 |isbn=1-59017-218-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-365.html Country Data]&lt;/ref&gt; while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

Starting from the end of the nineteenth century, people of European descent in Algeria (or natives like [[Spanish people]] in [[Oran]]), as well as the native Algerian [[Jew]]s (typically [[Sephardic]] in origin), became full French citizens. After Algeria's 1962 independence, they were called ''[[pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]''; (&quot;Pieds Noirs&quot; meaning &quot;black feet&quot;, referring to the black shoes the Europeans wore on their feet). In contrast, the vast majority of [[Muslim]] Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote.

===Post-independence===

In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[Algerian War of Independence]] which was a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign. By the end of the war, newly elected [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], understanding that the age of empire was ending, held a [[referendum|plebiscite]], offering Algerians three options. In a famous speech (4 June 1958 in Algiers) de Gaulle proclaimed in front of a vast crowd of Pieds-Noirs &quot;Je vous ai compris&quot; (I understood you). Most Pieds-noirs then believed that de Gaulle meant that Algeria would remain French. The poll resulted in a landslide vote for complete independence from France. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for France and in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 ''Pieds-Noirs'', as well as 81,000 ''[[Harki]]s'' (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army).  In the days proceeding the bloody conflict, a group of Algerian Rebels opened fire on a marketplace in Oran killing numerous innocent civilians, mostly women.  

[[Image:Algeri04.jpg|thumb|right|Cosmopolitan Algiers]]

Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. He was overthrown by his former ally and defence minister, [[Houari Boumédienne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly [[socialism|socialist]] and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and this trend continued throughout Boumédienne's government. However, Boumédienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. [[Agriculture]] was [[collective farming|collectivised]], and a massive [[industrialization]] drive launched. [[Oil]] extraction facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil which led to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].

In foreign policy,  while Algeria shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring Morocco, the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other ever since Algeria's independence. Reasons for this include Morocco's [[Greater Morocco|disputed claim to portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963), Algeria's support for the [[Polisario Front]] for its right to [[self-determination]], and Algeria's hosting of [[Sahrawi]] refugees within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]].

Within Algeria, dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the [[Mass media|media]] and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.

Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open. The state took on a strongly [[bureaucratic]] character and [[Political corruption|corruption]] was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable [[demography|demographic]] changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as [[urbanization]] increased. New industries emerged, agricultural employment was substantially reduced. [[Education]] was extended nationwide, raising the [[literacy]] rate from less than 10% to over 60%. There was a dramatic increase in the [[fertility rate]] to 7–8 children per mother.

Therefore by 1980, there was a very youthful population and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: communists, including Berber identity movements; and Islamic 'intégristes'. Both groups protested against [[one-party rule]] but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in Autumn 1988 forced Bendjedid to concede the end of one-party rule. Elections were planned to happen in 1991.
In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multi-party elections. The military then intervened and cancelled the second round. It forced then-president Bendjedid to resign and banned all political parties based on religion (including the Islamic Salvation Front). A political conflict ensued, leading Algeria into the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].
[[Image:Algerian massacres 1997-1998.png|thumb|right|300px|Massacres near Algiers, Algeria in the years of 1997 and 98 during the Algerian Civil War]]
More than 160,000 people were killed between 17 January 1992 and June 2002. Most of the deaths were between militants and government troops, but a great number of civilians were also killed. The question of who was responsible for these deaths was controversial at the time amongst academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. Though many of these massacres were carried out by Islamic extremists, the Algerian regime also used the army and foreign mercenaries to conduct attacks on men, women and children and then proceeded to blame the attacks upon various Islamic groups within the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html Khilafah - An overview of recent events in Algeria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Algiers]]]]
Elections resumed in 1995, and after 1998, the war waned. On 27 April 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the [[military]], [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/algehis.htm Arabic German Consulting] www.Arab.de (accessed 4 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an [[amnesty]] program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas (See [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002–present)]]).

The issue of [[Amazigh languages|Amazigh language]] and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]].The government responded with concessions including naming of Tamazight (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

Much of Algeria is now recovering and developing into an [[emerging economy]]. The high prices of oil and [[gas]] are being used by the new government to improve the country's [[infrastructure]] and especially improve [[industry]] and agricultural land. Recently, overseas investment in Algeria has increased.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

[[Image:Algeria Topography.png|right|thumb|300px|Topographic map of Algeria]]

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Algeria}}
Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the [[Tell Atlas]] is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape, which ends with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; further south, there is the [[Sahara]] desert. The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار‎}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about 1,500&amp;nbsp;km (932 miles) south of the capital, Algiers and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. 

[[Algiers]], [[Oran, Algeria|Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.

===Climate and hydrology===
Northern Algeria is in the [[temperate]] zone and has a mild, [[Mediterranean climate]]. Its broken [[topography]], however, provides sharp local contrasts in both prevailing temperatures and incidence of rainfall. [[Image:Alger front de mer.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The waterfront in Algiers near the [[Kasbah]] ]] Year-to-year variations in climatic conditions are also common.

In the Tell Atlas, temperatures in summer average between 21 and 24 °C and in winter drop to 10 to 12 °C. Winters are not particularly cold, but the humidity level is high. In eastern Algeria, the average temperatures are somewhat lower, and on the [[steppe]]s of the [[High Atlas]] plateaux, winter temperatures are only a few degrees above freezing. A prominent feature of the climate in this region is the [[sirocco]], a dusty, choking south wind blowing off the desert, sometimes at gale force. This wind also occasionally reaches into the coastal Tell.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

[[Image:Hoggar3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Ahaggar Mountains]]]]

In Algeria, only a relatively small corner of the torrid Sahara lies across the [[Tropic of Cancer]] in the [[tropics|torrid zone]]. In this region even in winter, midday desert temperatures can be very hot. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest temperature recorded in Tiguentour is 145.4°F (60.5°C) and is probably the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Algeria under standard conditions.

Rainfall is fairly abundant along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from 400 to 670 mm annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as 1000 mm in some years. Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. [[Prevailing winds]] that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months. Algeria also has [[Erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes between mountains, which in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Algeria}}

[[Image:President-abdelaziz-bouteflika.JPG|thumb|180px|left|[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], [[President of Algeria]].]]
The head of state is the [[President of Algeria]], who is elected to a five year term and is constitutionally limited to two terms. Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of a lower chamber, the ''National People's Assembly (APN)'', with 380 members; and an upper chamber, the ''Council Of Nation'', with 144 members. The APN is elected every five years.

Under the 1976 [[constitution]] (as modified 1979, and amended in 1988, 1989, and 1996) Algeria is a multi-party state. All parties must be approved by the Ministry of the Interior. To date, Algeria has had more than 40 legal political parties. According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender or region.&quot;

==Foreign relations and military==
[[Image:ANP.gif|50px|left]]
{{main|Foreign relations of Algeria|Military of Algeria|}}
The military of Algeria consists of the [[National Popular Army]] (ANP), the [[Algerian National Navy]] (MRA), and the [[Algerian Air Force]] (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; It is the direct successor of the [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front, which fought French colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). The commander-in-chief of the military is the president, who is also Minister of National Defense. Total personnel includes 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2008 |author=Hackett, James (ed.)|others=International Institute for Strategic Studies |date=5 February 2008|publisher=Europa |isbn=978-1857434613| url=http://www.zawya.com/printstory.cfm?storyid=v51n20-1TS05&amp;l=134200080519|accessdate=2008-07-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of eighteen months (six training and twelve in civil projects).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096 million),&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB/&gt; or 3.3% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

Algeria is a leading military power in [[North Africa]] and has its force oriented toward its western ([[Morocco]]) and eastern ([[Libya]]) borders. Its primary military supplier has been the former [[Soviet Union]], which has sold various types of sophisticated equipment under military trade agreements, and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Algeria has attempted, in recent years, to diversify its sources of military material. Military forces are supplemented by a 45,000-member [[gendarmerie]] or rural police force under the control of the president and 30,000-member ''Sûreté nationale'' or Metropolitan [[police]] force under the Ministry of the Interior. 

In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with [[Russia]] to purchase 49 [[MiG-29]]SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated $1.5 Billion. They also agreed to return old [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]]s purchased from the [[Former USSR]]. Russia is also building 2 636-type diesel [[submarines]] for Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Maghreb  Union==
Tensions between Algeria and [[Morocco]] in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Maghreb Union]] and the yearned ''Great Magreb Sultanate'', which was nominally established in 1989 but carried little practical weight with its coastal neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics, 2/19/1999] www.arabicnews.com (accessed 4 April 2006) &lt;/ref&gt;

== Provinces and districts ==
{{main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria}}
{{see|Municipalities of Algeria}}
[[Image:Algeria wilayas.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of the provinces of Algeria numbered according to the official order]]
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|province]]s ([[wilaya]]s), 553 [[districts of Algeria|district]]s ([[daïra]]s) and 1,541 [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] ([[Municipalities of Algeria|commune]]s, [[baladiyah]]s). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[capital|seat]], which is mostly also the largest city.
[[Image:Algierstowncentre.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown Algiers]]
According to the Algerian constitution, a province is ''a territorial collectivity enjoying some economic freedom''. The [[People's Provincial Assembly]] is the political entity governing a province, which has a &quot;president&quot;, who is elected by the members of the assembly. They are in turn elected on [[universal suffrage]] every five years. The &quot;[[Wāli#Algerian term|Wali]]&quot; ([[Prefect]] or [[governor]]) directs each province. This person is chosen by the [[Algerian President]] to handle the PPA's decisions.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Algeria}}
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of Algeria's economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. The country ranks fourteenth in [[petroleum]] reserves, containing {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl|m3}} of proven oil reserves with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven [[natural gas]] reserves, the eighth largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;eia&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html Algeria Country Analysis Brief], EIA, March 2005. Retrieved 18 Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Ministerefinacealger.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ministry of Finances of Algeria]]
Algeria’s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[debt]] rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria’s finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in [[oil]] prices and the government’s tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in [[foreign debt]]. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic [[investment]] outside the energy sector have had little success in reducing high [[unemployment]] and improving living standards, however. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade. In March 2006, [[Russia]] agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era debt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtsis.com/ Brtsis, brief on Russian defence, trade, security and energy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; during a visit by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president [[Bouteflika]] agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter [[Rosoboronexport]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |title=Russia agrees Algeria arms deal, writes off debt |publisher=Reuters |date=11 March 2006 |url=http://za.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-11T082958Z_01_BAN130523_RTRIDST_0_OZABS-ECONOMY-RUSSIA-ALGERIA-20060311.XML}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite news |title=La Russie efface la dette algérienne |publisher=Radio France International |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/075/article_42379.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria also decided in 2006 to pay off its full $8bn (£4.3bn) debt to the [[Paris Club]] group of rich creditor nations before schedule. This will reduce the Algerian foreign debt to less than $5bn in the end of 2006. The [[Paris Club]] said the move reflected Algeria's economic recovery in recent years.

== Agriculture ==
Algeria has always been noted for the fertility of its soil. 25% of Algerians are employed in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html#Econ CIA factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the [[United States]]' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards. In the early years of the twentieth century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed. A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases. Large quantities of a vegetable that resembles [[mane|horsehair]], an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm. The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and oil) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success. 

More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000&amp;nbsp;km²) are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s. The [[Tell Atlas|Tell]] is the grain-growing land. During the time of [[France|French]] rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] in districts which only required water to make them fertile. Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals. A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, are exported. Algeria also exports [[fig]]s, [[date (fruit)|dates]], [[esparto|esparto grass]], and [[cork (material)|cork]]. It is the largest [[oat]] market in Africa. 

Algeria is known for Bertolli's [[olive oil]] spread, although the spread has an Italian background.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Algeria demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Algeria, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005; number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
{{main|Demographics of Algeria}}
The population of Algeria is 33,333,216 (July 2007 est.).&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;
About 70% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic. Almost 30% of Algerians are under 15. Algeria has the fourth lowest [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the [[Greater Middle East]] after [[Cyprus]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

97% of the population is classified ethnically as either Arab or Berber. and religiously as [[Sunni Muslim]], the few non-Sunni Muslims are mainly [[Ibadi]]s, representing 1.3%, from the [[Mzab|M'Zab]] valley. (See also [[Islam in Algeria]].)  A mostly foreign [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] community of about 45,000 people exists, along with about 350,000 [[Protestant]] Christians, and some 500 [[Jewish]]. The [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Jewish community of Algeria]], which once constituted 2% of the total population, has substantially decreased due to emigration, mostly to [[France]] and [[Israel]]. 

Europeans account for less than 1% of the population, inhabiting almost exclusively the largest metropolitan areas. However, during the colonial period there was a large (15.2% in 1962) European population, consisting primarily of [[French people]], in addition to [[Spaniards]] in the west of the country, [[Italians]] and [[Maltese people|Maltese]] in the east, and other Europeans in smaller numbers. Known as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', European colonists were concentrated on the coast and formed a majority of the population of cities like [[Annaba|Bône]], [[Oran]], [[Sidi Bel Abbès]], and [[Algiers]]. Almost all of this population left during or immediately after the country's independence from France.

Housing and medicine continue to be pressing problems in Algeria. Failing infrastructure and the continued influx of people from rural to urban areas has overtaxed both systems. According to the [[UNDP]], Algeria has one of the world's highest per housing unit occupancy rates for housing, and government officials have publicly stated that the country has an immediate shortfall of 1.5 million housing units.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Women make up 70 percent of Algeria’s lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. Women dominate medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, according to university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 95,700 [[refugees]] and [[asylum]] seekers have sought refuge in Algeria.  This includes roughly 90,000 from [[Morocco]] and 4,100 from Former [[Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. &quot;World Refugee Survey 2008.&quot; Available Online at: http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=2116. pp.34&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
The majority of Algerians are ethnic [[Arabs]] while a minority are of Berber stock&lt;ref&gt;MSN Encarta. Muqaddimah Ibn Khaldun&lt;/ref&gt;. The Berber people are divided into several ethnic groups, [[Kabyle]] in the mountainous north-central area, [[Chaoui]] in the eastern [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Mozabite]]s in the [[M'zab]] valley, and [[Tuareg]] in the far south, while the Arabs make up the rest of Algeria.

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Algeria}}
[[Image:Kabylia-3lingual sign.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Trilingual welcome sign in the Isser Municipality (Boumerdès), written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Amazigh language|Amazigh]] ([[Tifinagh]]), and [[French language|French]], typical of Berber cities.  Most of Algeria uses only Arabic and French signs.
]]
[[Algerian Arabic]] is spoken by over 90% percent of the population.&lt;ref name=tlfq&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/AFRIQUE/algerie-1demo.htm http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/], [[Jacques Leclerc (linguiste)|Jacques Leclerc]], L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde. CIRAL (Centre international de recherche en aménagement linguistique).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the media and on official occasions the spoken language is [[Standard Arabic]].

The [[Berber people|Berber]]s (or [[Imazighen]]), who form a small minority, speak one of the various dialects of [[Tamazight]] as opposed to Arabic. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] remains Algeria's only [[official language]], although [[Tamazight]] has recently been recognized as a [[national language]] alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portant révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on 10 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The language issue is politically sensitive, particularly for the Berber minority, which has been disadvantaged by state-sanctioned [[Arabization]]. [[Language politics]] and Arabization have partly been a reaction to the fact that 130 years of [[France|French]] [[colonialism|colonization]] had left both the state [[bureaucracy]] and much of the educated upper class completely [[Francophone]], as well as being motivated by the [[Arab nationalism]] promoted by successive Algerian governments. 

[[French language|French]] is still the most widely studied [[foreign language]] in the country, and many Algerians speak it fluently, though it is usually not spoken in daily circumstances. Since [[independence]], the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of [[education]] and bureaucracy, with some success, although many [[university]] courses continue to be taught in French. Recently, schools have started to incorporate French into the curriculum as early as children start to learn Arabic. French is also used in media and commerce.

== Education ==
[[Image:Casbah alger.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Young inhabitants of Algiers in the streets of the [[Casbah|Kasbah of Algiers]].]]
Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 15. In the year 1997, there was an outstanding amount of teachers and students in primary schools. 

In Algeria there are 10 universities, 7 colleges, and 5 institutes for higher learning. The University of Algiers (founded in 1909), which is located in the capital of Algeria, Algiers has about 267,142 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Algeria-EDUCATION.html Algeria - Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian school system is structured into Basic, General Secondary, and Technical Secondary levels:
; Basic: Ecole fondamentale (Fundamental School)&lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 10 years&lt;br/&gt;Age range: age 6 to 15 old&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Brevet d'Enseignement Moyen B.E.M. [[Image:Tasdawit n Bgayet 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Béjaïa University]]
; General Secondary: Lycée d'Enseignement général (School of General Teaching), lycées polyvalents (General-Purpose School) &lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 3 years&lt;br/&gt;Age range: age 15 to 18&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Baccalauréat de l'Enseignement secondaire &lt;/br&gt;(Bachelor's Degree of Secondary School)
; Technical Secondary: Lycées d'Enseignement technique (Technical School)&lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 3 years&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Baccalauréat technique (Technical Bachelor's Degree)

== Culture and Sports==
{{main|Culture of Algeria}}
[[Image:Monument of the Martyrs 01 Algiers.jpg|thumb|left|The Monument of the Martyrs (Maqaam al-Shaheed) in Algiers]]
[[Image:Algiers mosque.jpg|thumb|right|The El Jedid [[Mosque]] in Algiers]]
Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the twentieth century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[Kateb Yacine]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. (accessed 4 April 2006) &lt;/ref&gt; 
In philosophy and the humanities, [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of [[deconstruction]], was born in [[El Biar]] in [[Algiers]]; [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.
Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir [[Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

The [[Music of Algeria|Algerian musical]] genre best known abroad is [[raï]], a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] [[Image:Khaled Hadj Brahim.jpg‎|thumb|right|Algerian singer [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]]]] and [[Cheb Mami]].  In Algeria itself the style of raï remains the most popular, but the older generation still prefer Shaabi, while the tuneful melodies of [[Kabyle]] music, exemplified by [[Idir]], [[Ait Menguellet]], or [[Lounès Matoub]], have a wide audience. For more classical tastes, [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusi music]], brought from [[Al-Andalus]] by [[Morisco]] refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns. For a more modern style, the English-born and of Algerian descent, [[Potent C]], is gradually becoming a success for younger generations. Encompassing a mixture of folk, raï, and British hip hop it is a highly collective and universal genre. 

Other artists bring a modern style of music to Algeria. [[Salma Ghazali]] and [[Souad Massi]] [[Image:Souad Massi.jpg|thumb|right|Souad Massi in concert]] are two famous Algerian female singers.

[[Image:Faudel concert June08 - 4.jpg|thumb|left|Faudel in concert]]

[[Faudel]] also brings a new [[europop]] like sound to Algeria, though a lot of his song are sung in [[French language|French]]. Other musicians and singers come out of Algeria as well. [[Popular music]] and [[Rap]] are becoming more popular in the country and are being song in written less in French and more in [[Algerian Arabic]].

Although {{cite web |url= http://algeria-raï.com/ |title=“[[raï]]&quot; }} is welcomed and praised as a glowing cultural emblem for Algeria, there was time when raï’s come across critical cultural and political conflicts with Islamic and government policies and practices, post-independence. Thus the distribution and expression of raï music became very difficult. However, “then the government abruptly reversed its position in mid-1985. In part this was due to the lobbying of a former liberation army officer turned pop music impresario, Colonel Snoussi, who hoped to profit from raï if it could be mainstreamed.”&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. &quot;Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Raï, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.&quot; Diaspora 3:1 (1994): 3–39. [Reprinted in The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader, ed. by Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, given both nations’ relations, Algerian government was pleased with the music’s growing popularity in France. Although the music is widely accepted on the political level, it still faces severe conflict with the practice of Islamic faith in Algeria. 

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khadda.com/ Mohammed Khadda] official site (accessed 4 April 2006) &lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'Hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.

[[Image:Stade 20 aout 1955-Alger.jpg|thumb|left|300px|20 August 1955 Stadium in Algiers, used mostly for football games]]

Sports, especially [[Association football|football]] are very big in Algeria. [[Baseball]] is also rising as a major sport in the country, especially the younger generation. [[Ice Hockey]] is popular in Algeria too [[Josef Boumedienne]] is a famous Algerian hockey player.

The most popular sport in the country is [[Association football|football]]. Since and before the upset in [[Gijon, Spain]] at El Molinon by [[Lakhdar Belloumi]] of the Algerian national football team defeating [[West German]] in 1982. But because of conflicts, and the poor conditions in Algerian through the 1990s and continuing in some areas of the country today many athletes have left Algeria for countries they could earn more and rise higher in, usually [[France]]. Retired football great [[Zinedine Zidane]] as well as young prodigies [[Karim Benzema]] and [[Samir Nasri]] are all second generation Algerian immigrants.

[[Image:Olympique de Marseille - Girondins de Bordeaux 2007 2008 Samir Nasri.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Samir Nasri]]

A lot of the sports events in the Algerian capital of Algiers happen in the 20 August 1955 stadium, which holds only about 15,000 people. This stadium is used usually for soccer games.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Objectivism}}
This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Balph Eubank==
Called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he is incapable of writing anything that people actually want to read. What people ''want'' to read, he says, is irrelevant. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. He is a member of the ''Looters''. Balph Eubank appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Ben Nealy==
A railroad contractor whom ''Dagny Taggart'' hires to replace the track on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Rio Norte Line|Rio Norte Line]] with [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged#Rearden Metal|Rearden Metal]]. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement, and this is manifest in his inability to organize the project and to make decisions. He relies on Dagny and ''Ellis Wyatt'' to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. Ben Nealy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Bertram Scudder==
Editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on ''Hank Rearden'' called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Equalization of Opportunity Bill|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Later on he has a radio interview program, in which Dagny Taggart is forced to appear by the threat of revelation of her relationship with Rearden - but she turns the tables by herself revealing the relationship, taking pride in it and denouncing the regime. In the aftermath, Scudder is made the scapegoat and loses his job.   Bertram Scudder appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

Science Fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] also used the family name &quot;Scudder&quot; for a despicable villain (in this case, [[Nehemiah Scudder]], a backwoods preacher who becomes a theocratic dictator of The United States) in the story &quot;[[If This Goes On—]]&quot;. It was published in 1953 - four years before &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; - but there is no evidence of a direct influence between the two.

==Betty Pope==
A wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with ''James Taggart'' that coincides with the overall meaninglessness of her life. She regrets having to wake up every morning because she has to face another empty day. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. Betty Pope appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 142 and 161.
==Brakeman==
An unnamed employee working on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Comet|Taggart Comet]] train. ''Dagny Taggart'' hears Brakeman whistling the theme of a concerto. When she asks him what piece it is from, he says it is Halley's Fifth Concerto. When Dagny points out that ''Richard Halley'' only wrote four concertos, Brakeman claims he made a mistake and that he does not recall where he heard the piece.

Later, after Dagny instructs the train crew how to proceed, he asks a co-worker who she is, and learns she is the one who runs [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]].

It is later discovered that the unknown brakeman is one of the strikers, when Dagny finds him working in Galt's Gulch as an employee of Ellis Wyatt and an apprentice to Richard Halley. Brakeman appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 113.

==Cherryl Brooks==
Dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. She is horrible to Dagny until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had all of the Taggart family's positive traits - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Like Eddie Willers, Cherryl is one representation of a &quot;good&quot; person who lacks the extraordinary capacities of the primary heroes of the novel.

==Claude Slagenhop==
The president of political organization Friends of Global Progress (which is supported by ''Philip Rearden''), and one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. He is not bothered by the fact that action unguided by ideas is random and pointless. Global Progress is a sponsor of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Claude Slagenhop appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==Cuffy Meigs==
A thuggish personage who's assigned by Wesley Mouch to keep watch over the workings of Taggart Transcontinental, and later assumes control over the company after Dagny Taggart leaves. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform. The &quot;spiritual heir&quot; of Dr. Robert Stadler, Meigs comes to a fitting end at the hands of ''Project X.'' His role is to act as the frankly brutal face of the regime, which frightens and disgusts more hypocritical people. Though of a different profession, he is similar to the architect Gus Webb in [[The Fountainhead]], who similarly behaves in a crude and brutal manner and frightens more hypocritical architects. Both characters become prominent in the later part of their respective books, with Webb becoming Ellsworth Toohey's favorite in place of Keating when Toohey feels less need to keep a mask, while Meigs comes to prominence when the regime finds it impossible to continue with more subtle and seemingly civilized methods.

==Dagny Taggart==
{{main|Dagny Taggart}}

Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel, and, in general, it is Dagny's perception of the battle between [[John Galt (Atlas Shrugged)|John Galt]] and the Looters that is the readers'.  She holds the title of 'Operating Vice-President in Charge of Operations' of [[Taggart Transcontinental]], under her brother, [[Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]].  However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny that is actually responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Taggart has romantic relationships with three men of ability: [[Francisco d'Anconia]], [[Hank Rearden]], and John Galt.  Ultimately, she ends up with Galt, on account of the superiority of his talents and qualities.  Nonetheless, she remains on good terms with the other two, despite ending her sexual relationships with them.

Dagny personifies the typical struggle within many capitalists: when to stop trying to change the social policies that impinge on capitalist goals.  Hers is the most unusual perspective in the book, as she has one foot in each camp.  She tries to &quot;fix&quot; the social policies of the government while still maintaining her belief in free enterprise.  The ultimate lesson taught through Dagny is that reason cannot triumph over unreason until the unreasonable perish.

She is a typical [[Randian hero]]ine, similar to [[Dominique Francon]] (''The Fountainhead'') or [[Kira Argounova]] (''We the Living'').

Dagny appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 113, 114, 132, 133, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 151, 152, and 161.

==Dan Conway==
The middle-aged president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Phoenix-Durango]] railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]] is used to drive his business out of [[wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. He claims that somebody had to be sacrificed, it turned out to be him, and he has no right to complain, bowing to the will of the majority. When pressed he says he does not really believe this is right, but he cannot understand why it is wrong and what the alternative might be. He is trapped by a moral code that makes him a willing victim, and rather than challenge that morality, he simply gives up. Still, it is never clearly explained why he was never made part of Galt's &quot;strike&quot; (his private act of dropping out and living in retirement is quite in tune with it) and why he was never invited to the hidden valley where he would have fit right in. Dan Conway appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 145 and 146, and is mentioned in section 148.

The dialogue between Dan Conway and Dagny Taggart, with her urging Conway to fight the unjust decision taken against him and Conway refusing, is reminiscent of [[Plato]]'s famous dialogue &quot;[[Crito]]&quot;, where [[Crito of Alopece]] in vain urges the philosopher [[Socrates]] to flee the death punishment unjustly imposed on him. Socrates' basic argument - that he has obliged himself to abide by the laws of Athens, and must go on doing so even when the laws are unjust - is essentially the same as that offered by Conway who feels honour bound to abide by the rulings of the National Alliance of Railroads. Conway - who &quot;seldom read books and never went to college&quot; - would not be familiar with the philosophy of Socrates, but Rand certainty was. The comparison shows Rand taking the opposite view to that of Socrates - which is unsurprising, given that Socrates' position in the dialogue was in fact that of Plato, and Rand deeply loathed Plato and regarded him as the spiritual ancestor of [[Ellsworth Toohey]].

==Dick McNamara==
A contractor who finished the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] and who is hired to lay the new [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] track for the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]]. Before he gets a chance to do so, he mysteriously disappears. Dick McNamara is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.

==Eddie Willers==
Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with ''Dagny Taggart''. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]]. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the promethian creative ability of The Strikers, but nevertheless matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with a broken-down train in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him. Eddie Willers appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 117, 132, 133, 141, 151, and 152.

==Ellis Wyatt==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]] by discovering oil there. He is quick-tempered, more bound to violent outbursts than other characters. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are in fact her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. Of all the disappearances of industrialists in the novel, Wyatt's is surely the most dramatic: when the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he does not just go quietly away but sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; Without his expertise, the State Science Institute is unable to bring those wells back into production. One particular oil well that he set aflame, became known as Wyatt's Torch, which serves as an emblem for the cause of the Strikers, as well as a major symbol of the book. It is sometimes used for posters of the book, as well as book covers for some editions. 

Later, when Dagny meets him in the hidden valley where his energies are not encountering futile daily obstructions, there is little of that violence to be seen. Ellis Wyatt is mentioned or appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 132, 146, 147, 148, and 152.

==Francisco d'Anconia==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. Owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire, the man behind the San Sebastián Mines, and a childhood friend and first love of ''Dagny Taggart''.

Francisco began working on the sly as a teenager in order to learn all he could about business. While still a student at [[Places in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]], a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler, he began working at a copper foundry, and investing in the stock market. By the time he was twenty he had made enough to purchase the foundry. He began working for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|d'Anconia Copper]] as assistant superintendent of a mine in Montana, but was quickly promoted to head of the New York office. In this way he proved that, though unlike other charcters he was born to wealth and power, he could have made a successful career all by himself. He took over d'Anconia Copper at age 23, after the death of his father.

When he was 26, Francisco secretly joined the ''Strikers'' and began to slowly destroy the d'Anconia empire so the ''Looters'' could not get it. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.

He was the childhood friend of [[Dagny Taggart]] and [[Eddie Willers]] and later became Dagny's lover. Giving her up - since, knowing her intimately, he knew she would not be ready to join the strikers - was the hardest part for him. He remains deeply in love with her to the end of the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, John Galt and Hank Rearden.  

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia.

Francisco d'Anconia appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132, 141, 144, 151, and 152 - this last section includes a detailed history of his life.

==Fred Kinnan==

Fred Kinnan is a labour leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose.  At the meeting to decide on whether to enact Directive 10-289 (giving government sweeping powers over industry) Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. 

At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.

==Hank Rearden==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man who started as an ordinary worker, showed talent, founded [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Steel]] and made it the most important steel company of the US (and one of the most important business companies of any kind). Later, he conceived of and invented the Rearden Metal, a form of metal stronger than steel (it stands to steel as steel stands to ordinary iron). 

He is a demanding employer, intolerant of sloppy work, but pays his workers salaries &quot;above any union scale&quot;. He arouses a strong feeling of loyalty among the workers, and was never faced with a strike. 

He lives in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] with his wife ''Lillian'', his brother ''Philip'', and his elderly mother (whose name never appears in the book), all of whom he supports. [[Gwen Ives]] is his secretary.

The character of Hank Rearden has two important roles to play in the novel. First, he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is unsure of what it is. Rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with ''Francisco d'Anconia'', who does know the secret, and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[John Galt (Atlas Shrugged)|Galt's Speech]]. 

Second, Rearden is used to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]]. ''Lillian Rearden'' cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. ''Dagny Taggart'' clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire. Rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, while responding sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates Rand's sexual theory. Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, 147, and 161, and is mentioned in sections 114 and 131.

&quot;Rearden&quot; is a variety of &quot;[[Riordan]]&quot;, a surname of [[Ireland|Irish]] origin. There are, however, no specific Irish characteristics in the depiction of Hank Rearden, and it is clearly implied that his family had been in America for several generations.

==Hugh Akston==
Identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'', and ''Ragnar Danneskjöld''. He was, along with ''Robert Stadler'', a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that (Like many of Rand's characters, who feel no reluctance to work at &quot;menial&quot; jobs and do them well). When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. Hugh Akston is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==James Taggart==
The President of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]], a leader of the ''Looters'', and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is incapable of making decisions on his own. He relies on his sister ''Dagny Taggart'' to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the Looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

In the introduction to the 35th anniversary edition, (1991), [[Leonard Peikoff]] introduced excerpts from Rand's journals concerning the book. Among other things, it is disclosed that as originally conceived James Taggart was religious, regularly going to a priest to confess his sins and ask for absolution. There is no hint of this in the final version as published. Presumably, however, this &quot;asking for absolution&quot; was connected with the above-mentioned hiding of Taggart's real goal from himself. 

This also implies that the Taggart Family was originally conceived as being of [[Roman Catholic]] background, of which also there is little trace left in the published version. It fits well with the Taggarts' long-standing friendship with the Latin American D'Anconia Family. 

James Taggart appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 143, 144, 152 and 161, and is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 146 and 148.

==John Galt==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged]] --&gt;
{{main|John Galt (Atlas Shrugged)}}

The enigmatic John Galt is the male hero of Atlas Shrugged, and typifies the [[Randian hero]].  By trade, he is an [[engineer]], and has developed a revolutionary new [[motor]] powered by ambient static electricity that has the potential to change the world.  However, in disgust at the [[collectivization]] forced upon him at his workplace at the [[Twentieth Century Motor Company]], he goes on [[strike action|strike]], depriving the world of his invaluable invention.

To increase the impact, he persuades each individual of talent whom he considers to share [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|his own ethical creed]], to join him on strike, in a secret and secluded hiding place called [[Galt's Gulch]].  Amongst them are [[Francisco d'Anconia]] and [[Ragnar Danneskjöld]], with whom he had studied at [[Patrick Henry University]].  At first, [[Dagny Taggart]] considered Galt to be a destructive force, and grants him the epithet 'the Destroyer'.  However, when she is convinced of the futility of her own struggle, and the nobility of Galt's, she falls in love with him.

John Galt's name is enshrined in the question &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;  The phrase is used popularly as an expression of helplessness and despair at the sorry state of the world.  The answer is expressed in a range of [[John Galt Legends|legends]]: none of which is entirely true, but all of which reflect an aspect of his achievements and labours.

==Lillian Rearden==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atlas Shrugged]] --&gt;
The wildly unsupportive wife of ''Hank Rearden''. They have been married eight years as the novel begins.

Lillian is a frigid ''Moocher'' who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted.

Lillian also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|Theory of sex]]. Lillian believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness. She is incapable of feeling this kind of desire, which she believes testifies to her moral superiority. However, according to the theory of sex, Lillian's lack of sexual capacity results from her inability to experience value in herself; she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161 she indicates that she abhors ''Francisco d'Anconia'', because she believes he is a sexual adventurer. Lillian Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==The Looters==
A group of antagonistic characters sometimes referred to as &quot;James Taggart and his friends&quot;. They are similar to the Moochers. The Looters consist of men and women who use force to obtain value from those who produce it. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Looters include: Mr. Thompson, Balph Eubank, Floyd Ferris, James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Paul Larkin, Robert Stadler, Simon Pritchett, Wesley Mouch, Eugene Lawson, Cuffy Meigs and the Mexican government of the time.

==Midas Mulligan==
A wealthy banker, whose financial backing had a major share in launching the career of Hank Rearden and other prominent industrialists. He mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to loan money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, made sure that all the account holders received every penny due them, and joined Galt's strike. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment. Mulligan is responsible for the creation and distribution of the money that is exclusively used in Galt's Gulch, and is the original owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located hence its official name: Mulligan's Valley

==The Moochers==
A group of characters, similar to the ''Looters'', who use guilt as a weapon against those who produce value. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Moochers include ''Lillian Rearden'', ''Philip Rearden'', and Hank Rearden's ''mother''.

==Mort Liddy==
A [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies that no one listens to. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends and a member of the cultural elite. Mort Liddy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Mr. Mowen==
The president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc.]] of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. He is unable to grapple with abstract issues, and is frightened of anything controversial. Dagny Taggart hires Mr. Mowen to produce switches made of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract.  When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source. Mr. Mowen appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Mystery Worker  (John Galt)==
A menial worker for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] who often dines with ''Eddie Willers'' in the employee's cafeteria. Eddie finds him very easy to talk to, and Mystery Worker not-so-subtly leads him on so that Eddie reveals important information about ''Dagny Taggart'' and Taggart Transcontinental; Ayn Rand chooses to record only Eddie's side of each conversation. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on, and with remarkable consistency, those are the next men to disappear mysteriously. Later in the novel the reader discovers the true identity of the Mystery Worker to be John Galt. Mystery Worker appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 133.

==The unnamed newsstand owner==
He works in the Taggart Terminal. Twenty years ago he owned a cigarette factory but it went under, and he's been working at his newsstand ever since. He is a collector of cigarettes, and knows every brand ever made. He occasionally chats with ''Dagny Taggart'' when she comes by. On one occasion, in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132, after Dagny asks him about his collection, he bemoans the fact that there are no new brands and the old brands are all disappearing. He examines a cigarette given to Dagny by ''Hugh Akston'', but it is a new brand that he has never seen before. It carries the sign of the dollar.

==Orren Boyle==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Associated Steel]] and a friend of ''James Taggart''. He is one of the ''Looters''. He is an investor in the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastián Mines]]. Orren Boyle appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 144, and 152.

==Owen Kellogg==
Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]]. He catches ''Dagny Taggart's'' eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. He admits that he loves his work, but that is not enough to keep him. He will not say why he is leaving or what he will do. Later, he is noticed working as transient labor by the unsuccessful/unmotivated businessman ''Mr. Mowen''. Owen Kellog eventually reaches, and settles in, Atlantis. Owen Kellogg appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 114.

==Paul Larkin==
An unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family, and a member of the ''Looters''. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 Larkin visits [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] to warn ''Hank Rearden'' of possible trouble from [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 he meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them. Paul Larkin appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, and 2A1.
==Philip Rearden==
The younger brother of ''Hank Rearden'', and a ''Moocher''. He lives in his brother's home in [[Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He believes that the source of his sustenance is evil and would love to see him destroyed. He has never had a career and spends his time working for various social groups.
He becomes resentful of his brother's charity. He then requests that he be granted a job from his brother because he should not have to be burdened by the feeling of inadequacy of not earning his own livelihood. When confronted by his brother on how this job should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, Philip shrugs the argument off as irrelevant and that he should be entitled to the job solely based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties. Philip Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Quentin Daniels==
An enterprising engineer hired by ''Dagny Taggart'' to reconstruct ''John Galt's'' motor.  Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had.  Dagny sets out to meet Quentin in hopes of convincing him to resume his work.  John Galt narrowly gets to him first.  Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]].&quot;

==Ragnar Danneskjöld==
One of the original ''Strikers''. He is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar was from [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], the son of a bishop and the scion of one of Norway's most ancient, noble families. He attended [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with ''John Galt'' and ''Francisco d'Anconia'', while studying under ''Hugh Akston'' and ''Robert Stadler''. When he became a pirate, he was disowned and excommunicated. There is a price on his head in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Portugal]], [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Turkey]]. 

Ragnar seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|United States]] to [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Europe]]. As the novel progresses, Ragnar begins, for the first time, to become active in American waters, and is even spotted in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Delaware Bay]]. Reportedly, his ship is better than any available in the fleets of the world's navies. 

People assume that as a pirate he simply takes the seized goods to himself. However, while many other protagonists take pride in making a personal profit from the proceeds of their creativity, Danneskjöld's motivation is to restore to other creative people the money which was unjustly taken away from them - specifically, their [[income tax]] payments. 

For that purpose, Danneskjöld maintains a network of informants in the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] (and possibly also those of other countries) who provide him with detailed copies of the tax receipts; among other talents, Danneskjöld is mentioned as being a skilled [[accountant]].  The proceeds from the goods he seizes (presumably minus his operating expenses) are deposited in accounts opened in ''Midas Mulligan'''s bank in the names of various 
industrialists, to the amounts of the income tax taken from them - which are handed to them (in gold) upon their joining the ''Strikers''. 

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet ''Hank Rearden'' in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an &quot;advance payment&quot;, to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. 

As a robber with ideological principles, Danneskjöld superficially resembles the opposite or negative of [[Robin Hood]]; he considers Robin Hood as an arch-enemy which he had sworn to pursue and destroy - or rather, not Robin Hood the person, who is long dead, but the principle that it is permissible to rob the rich and give to the poor, a principle which in Danneskjöld's (and Rand's) view is highly pernicious. 

In the conversation with Rearden, Danneskjöld claims to limit himself to attacks on government property and never touch private property. This contradicts previous chapters where there is mention of Danneskjöld sinking ships belonging to ''D'anconia Copper'' and destroying ''Orren Boyle'''s plant on the coast of [[Maine]], where Boyle attempted to produce ''Rearden Metal''. However, the first does not truly constitute robbery, since it was done with the consent of and in collusion with the owner, Danneskjöld's old friend ''Francisco D'anconia'', and was aimed at helping Francisco's efforts to destroy his own company. And the second was in reaction to Boyle having violated, with government sanction, Rearden's [[intellectual property]] (the term did not yet exist at the time of writing).   

Danneskjöld is married to the former actress ''Kay Ludlow'' - a relationship kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a former famous [[film star]] who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the ''Strikers'' have strong reservations about his way of &quot;conducting the common struggle&quot;.

Members of Danneskjöld's crew, other than himself, are never named nor appear in the book. Evidently, they are not given access of the hidden valley where their captain sometimes goes, nor - on the basis of [[need to know]] - are they given its location, which they might give away if captured. 

Such a prolonged and successful piratical career would require a secret haven, probably on the Atlantic Coast of the US. In the end of the book, Danneskjöld's crew are mentioned as preparing to form a new community, while his ship would be converted into &quot;a modest ocean [[liner]]&quot;. Danneskjöld himself refreshes his knowledge of [[Aristotle]] and prepares to become a full-time [[philosopher]], and it is hinted that posterity might remember him mainly as ''Hugh Akston'''s disciple rather than as a pirate.    

According to Ayn Rand (verbal report), his name is a tribute to Victor Hugo.  In Hugo's first novel, ''Hans of Iceland'', the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.  His name may be a pun on 'Dane's Gold', although &quot;skjold&quot; means shield, not gold. The first name &quot;Ragnar&quot; recalls [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], one of the most famous of the [[viking]] leaders (to whose many piratical exploits no motive other than seeking loot was ever attributed). Ragnar Danneskjöld appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

However, there are some inaccuracies. 'Ö' is not a Norwegian letter, but a Swedish one; its Norwegian equivalent is 'ø'. &quot;Skjöld&quot; and &quot;skjøld&quot; still exists in Scandinavian surnames and is an old fashioned spelling of the word for &quot;shield&quot;, that is now &quot;skjold&quot; (Norwegian) and &quot;sköld&quot; (Swedish). Also, there is actually no noble class in Norway, as the [[Black Death]] of the Middle Ages forced any survivors to revert to [[subsistence farming]], and nobility itself was officially abolished by the Storting in 1821.

A possible inspiration might be Norwegian [[Trygve Hoff]] that Ayn Rand knew. Hoff was the editor of the [[Farmand]] business magazine and outspoken free market capitalist. Trygve Hoff was of an old fine Norwegian family &quot;Hoff&quot; owning grand estates outside the city of [[Tønsberg]] in Norway. Tryge Hoff was married to the Norwegian actress [[Aase Bye]]. Hoff was an admirer of Aristotle and a collector of ancient busts. Hoff also had the kind of hero-like looks Ayn Rand liked, similar looks to her husband [[Frank O'Conor]].

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing directly Danneskjöld's adventures at sea which were cut out from the final published text. &lt;ref&gt;Reedstrom, Karen.

Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rearden's mother==
Rearden's mother, whose name is not mentioned, is a ''Moocher'' who lives with her son ''Hank Rearden'' at his home in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]]. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She insults him by saying he was always selfish, even as a child. She dotes on her weak son ''Philip Rearden''. Rearden's mother appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Richard Halley==
Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 we learn that Richard Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24 his opera ''Phaethon'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. (It was based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] in which [[Phaethon]] steals his father's chariot, and dies in an audacious attempt to drive the sun across the sky. Halley changed the story, though, into one of triumph, in which Phaethon succeeds.) For years Halley wrote in obscurity. After nineteen years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. It appears his critics felt he had paid his dues long enough that he was at last worthy of their approval. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. Richard Halley is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114, 133, and 141, and appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.
==Dr. Robert Stadler==
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francsico d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt|John Galt]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar Danneskj.C3.B6ld|Ragnar Danneskjöld]]. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: ''Project X.'' The character might be modeled on [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].

==Dr. Simon Pritchett==
The prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Places in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and considered the leading philosopher of the age. He is also a ''Looter''. He is certainly representative of the philosophy of the age - he is a crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals; he believes there are no standards, that definitions are fluid, reason is a superstition, that it is futile to seek meaning in life, and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. He explains all this in his book ''The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe'', and at cocktail parties. Dr. Pritchett appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==The Strikers==
People of the mind who go on strike because they do not appreciate being exploited by ''the Looters'' and demonized by a society who depends on them for its very existence. The leader of the Strikers is ''John Galt''. Other Strikers include: Hugh Akston, Francisco d'Anconia, Ragnar Danneskjöld, Richard Halley, and the Brakeman. Characters who join the Strikers in the course of the book include: Dagny Taggart, Ellis Wyatt, Hank Rearden, Dick McNamara, and Owen Kellogg.
==Mr. Thompson==
The &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]],&quot; which essentially means that he's the [[President of the United States]], though he's never specifically referred to as such. In the world of ''Atlas Shrugged'' all Presidents and Prime Ministers are referred to simply as &quot;Head of the State&quot; and &quot;Mr. ____.&quot; This is because countries have been standardized as &quot;People's States&quot; which seem to share a common form of government. Thompson's title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact that the US is in the process of evolving into one of these &quot;People's States.&quot; One of the Looters, he's not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modelled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]].

==Wesley Mouch==
A member of the ''Looters'' and, at the beginning of the storyline, the incompetent lobbyist whom ''Hank Rearden'' reluctantly employs in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. Initially Wesley Mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the Looters - the other members of this group feel they can look down upon him with impunity. Eventually he becomes the most powerful Looter, and the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|country's]] economic dictator, thereby illustrating Rand's belief that a government-run economy places too much power in the hands of incompetent bureaucrats who would never have positions of similar influence in a private sector business. His name, of course, is a pun on the word &quot;mooch,&quot; his modus operandi. Wesley Mouch appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 and is mentioned in section 161.

==Wet Nurse (Tony)==

A young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers.  He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.

==Minor characters==
*An '''Airport Attendant''' at the airport near the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt oil fields]] tells ''Dagny Taggart'' (in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171) that ''Hank Rearden'' had left for [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]], revealing his lies. Rearden had told Dagny he was flying to [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Minnesota]].
*The '''Bartender''' works in the most expensive barroom in New York, frequented by ''James Taggart'' and the ''Looters'' (in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131).
*The '''Board of Directors''' of Taggart Transcontinental are a group of men mostly loyal to ''James Taggart''. Over the years of Taggart's presidency, many Board members have resigned in protest, leaving only those who think like Taggart. The Board represents the other people whose approval is necessary for people who are incapable of making decisions on their own, most notably Taggart, who treats approval of the Board as a scientific test of truth. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132 we learn the Board approved the development of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] and that numerous Board members quit in protest (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 114, 132, 143 and 145).
*The '''Bum''' opens the book with the question, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;. He chats for a moment with ''Eddie Willers'' helping establish (for the reader) Eddie's sense of unease (in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 111)
*An unnamed '''Businessman''' interrupts a conversation between ''Dagny Taggart'' and ''Hank Rearden'' at the party in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161. He is taken aback by the contrast between Dagny's appearance that night and the way she normally appears in her business suits. When Dagny notes his reaction she realizes she had hoped Rearden would react that way, that this was her unadmitted purpose in coming to the party.
*The '''Chief Engineer''' phones ''Eddie Willers'' to tell him that his boss, ''Dick McNamara'' has closed his business and quit without explanation (in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141).
*'''Chief Engineer 2''' maintains [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] at a time when all the competent men have disappeared. Since he can only imitate, and not innovate, he is unenthusiastic about having to work with [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. ''Dagny Taggart'' tells him to design a new bridge to be built with Rearden Metal, but rejects his design because it is a copy of a steel bridge that does not take into account the properties of the new alloy. He is offended by this because his bridge was a good copy of the bridges he was taught to imitate (appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171).
*'''Clarence Eddington''' is an economic consultant whom ''James Taggart'' blames for the decision to build the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 143).
*The '''Conductor''' works on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Comet]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112 he explains to ''Dagny Taggart'' that he is waiting for a broken light to change.  He represents the type of incompetent, initiativeless worker who is concerned only with following the rules so no one can blame him for anything.
*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental.  He is partially responsible for Kip Chalmers' death.
*'''Dagny's father''' (who is unnamed) was the president of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] prior to ''James Taggart''. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132 we learn he was &quot;astonished and proud&quot; of his daughter, but sad for her as well, and apparently not overly supportive of her desire to work for the railroad, though he did nothing to stop her.
*'''Dagny's mother''' is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152. She worried about her daughter's apparent lack of interest in boys, and never understood Dagny's desire to work for the railroad. Because of her lack of understanding, she was never able to give Dagny guidance or support, though she was kind and caring within her limits.
*'''Dr. Floyd Ferris''' One of the Looter crowd who takes credit, along with Wesley Mouch, for Project X though he is considered too stupid to have contributed anything to the project.
*'''Dr. Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.
*The '''Engineer''' appears briefly in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112. When ''Dagny Taggart'' wakes up to find the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] stalled on a siding, he explains to her why they stopped. He represents the type of incompetent, initiativeless worker who is concerned only with following the rules so no one can blame him for anything.
*The '''Fireman''' appears briefly in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112.  While ''Dagny Taggart'' is trying to find out why the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] has stalled, Fireman shows his amusement at how things like this happen.
*'''Francisco's father''' was the head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|d'Anconia Copper]] before his son. He raised ''Francisco'' to be a worthy heir to the mining empire and was very proud to see that he would be. One establishing moment for Francisco's father is when Francisco purchases a dilapidated copper mine at the age of 20. Although d'Anconia's publicist detests the family name being prominently displayed on the plant, Francisco's father has a photo of the plant placed in his office. He died when Francisco was 23 (appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152).
*'''Gerald Starnes and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of ''Jed Starnes''; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which killed worker morale, convinced ''John Galt'' to quit the factory, and drove the company into bankruptcy.  Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.
*'''Gertrude''' is the new cook of the Rearden household (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 241).
*'''Gilbert Vail''' was allegedly cuckolded by ''Francisco d'Anconia''. His wife asserts, and Francisco does not deny, that she and Francisco had an affair over New Years at his villa in the [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Andes]]. Gilbert is shot by his wife, but survives, and when he sues for divorce she threatens to spill the details of his sordid private life. Just as the scandal is reaching a crescendo in the tabloids, Francisco arrives in town to &quot;witness the farce.&quot; (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141).
*'''James Taggart's Secretary''' has the unhappy job of explaining to Taggart why Francisco d'Anconia will not see him: &quot;Senor d'Anconia said that you bore him, Mr. Taggart.&quot;
*'''Jed Starnes''' founded Twentieth Century Motors, and made it the most profitable company of its kind in America before his death.
*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.
*'''Jock Benson''' is a friend of ''Betty Pope'', who told her that ''James Taggart'' did not really run the railroad; his sister did.
*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. He is a staunch supporter of the [[inalienable rights]] theory, and in the final pages he is seen rewriting the [[United States Constitution]] to state those rights more explicitly.
*'''Jules Mott''' is [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental's]] man in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Mexico City]]. He is the fall guy after the Mexican government nationalizes the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]]  (appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 142 and is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 143).
*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that was carrying him encountered a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine-at that point, one of the last of its kind left anywhere in the world. After a chilling show of bureaucracy, a coal-burning steam engine was attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. This action, for whom no one could later be blamed, resulted in suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.
*'''Emma Chalmers''' is Kip's mother (see above) and gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.
*'''Liz Blaine''' is a friend of Betty Pope.
*'''Mr. Ayers''' is the head of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Ayers Music Publishing Company]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 114 ''Dagny Taggart'' calls him to inquire if ''Richard Halley'' has written a fifth concerto.
*'''Mr. Coleman''' is an employee of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.
*'''Mrs. Beacham''' is a friend of ''Rearden's Mother'' who does charity work for the parish school (mentioned briefly in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121).
*'''Mrs. Gilbert Vail''' claims she had a love affair with ''Francisco d'Anconia'' in his villa in the [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Andes]]. Afterwards, she shot her husband so she could leave him and be with Francisco. ''Gilbert Vail'' survived and sued for divorce, at which point his wife promised to reveal the sordid details of his private life to the press. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152 we learn that Francisco was in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|El Paso, Texas]], not in the Andes, at the time when Mrs. Vail claims to have been with him.  Mrs. Vail is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 141 and 152.
*'''Mrs. Nathaniel Taggart''' is mentioned briefly in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132 and in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152. According to legend, ''Nathaniel Taggart'' put his wife up as collateral for a loan, with her consent. She was a beautiful, dignified southern lady from a good family, from which she was disinherited when she ran off with ''Taggart'', still a poor adventurer at the time.  Her name was Dagny, and is ''Dagny Taggart's'' namesake.
*'''Mrs. Weston''' is a friend of ''Lillian Rearden'' who attends the Rearden's anniversary party. She is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 162.
*'''Mrs. Whitcomb''' is a woman who moves in the same circles as ''Lillian Rearden'' (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161).
*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' widow of William Hastings. Graying hair, has a poised distinguished look of grooming. Gives Dagny a lead where she discovers Hugh Akston working as a cook in a roadside diner.
*'''Nathaniel Taggart''' is meant to symbolize the so-called Robber Barons of America's industrial age. Nat Taggart was the founder of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]]. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. Many stories are told about him: that he once killed a state legislator who tried to use his office to destroy the railroad; that he once put his wife up as collateral for a loan. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132 and 152).
*'''Nat Taggart's son''' built a bridge that is falling to pieces, which will be replaced by the Rearden Metal bridge (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171).
*An unnamed '''Newspaperman''', seedy and deliberately rude, speaks to  ''Hank Rearden'' in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Passenger Number 1''' on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112 he tells ''Dagny Taggart'' how long the train has been stopped after she wakes up.
*'''Passenger Number 2''' talks with the ''Conductor'', the ''Fireman'', and the ''Engineer'' when ''Dagny Taggart'' approaches to find out why the train has stopped. When she acts as if this sort of problem is unusual and should not happen, he tells her she does not understand [[railroad]]s.
*'''Passenger Number 3''' is an economics professor. As the train passes [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Steel]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121, he focuses on the fact that ''Hank Rearden'' has proudly put his name on the company. He scoffs at this, dismissing the individual as unimportant.
*'''Passenger Number 4''' is a journalist who gazes at the steel mill and focuses on the fact that ''Hank Rearden'' has proudly put his name on the company. He decides he will ridicule Rearden in a future column by calling him the sort of man who sticks his name on everything.
*'''Pop Harper''' is chief clerk at the offices of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]]. He complains that it is impossible to get new typewriters, and that the world will soon be without this simple device. His attitude is that there is nothing to be done and things will just happen as they happen. This attitude explains why, after a lifetime of labor, he is still merely a clerk (appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 111).
*'''President of ULW''' is an unnamed president of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|United Locomotive Works]]&amp;mdash;an incompetent industrialist who considers directness a sign of ill-breeding. When ''Dagny Taggart'' tries to find out why his company has failed to deliver an order, he refuses to give an answer, despite talking for hours (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141).
*'''Sebastian d'Anconia''' is an ancestor of ''Francisco d'Anconia'' who fled [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Spain]] during the time of the Inquisition, settled in [[:Wikibooks:Transwiki:Places in Atlas Shrugged|Argentina]], and founded [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|d'Anconia Copper]]. His story is told in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.
*'''Simons''' is a member of the Rearden household staff, mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 162.
*The '''Spinster''' tells Dagny a [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt Legend]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Tom Colby''' is the head of the steelworkers union chapter of Rearden Steel.  The workforce of Rearden Steel is the highest paid, and therefore the best, in the country, so Colby rarely challenges his boss.  Like Eddie Willers, he is not a ''Striker'', but he is smart enough to not side with the ''Moochers'' or ''Looters.''  When he retires from Rearden Steel, he assures Hank Rearden that he is on his side.
*The '''Waiter''' serves drinks to the ''Looters'' in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131.
*An unnamed '''worker''' at [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Steel]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121. He is on hand the night the first order of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] is poured, and smiles at ''Hank Rearden'' in acknowledgement of his accomplishment. This is the only acknowledgement Rearden receives.
*'''William Hastings''' Deceased five years as of Dagny's meeting with his widow. The head of the laboratory of the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Galt worked for him until the Starnes heirs took over the factory; Hastings quit just after Galt did and joined the strike some years later.

==Planned characters excluded from the final version==

In the introduction to the 35th anniversary edition, (1991), [[Leonard Peikoff]] introduced excerpts from Rand's journals concerning the book, which she originally intended to call &quot;The Strike&quot;. Among many other things, the journals reveal some characters which were originally planned to appear in the book and were deleted from the final version.

===Father Amadeus===

Peikoff tells that &quot;'''Father Amadeus''' was Taggart's priest, to whom he confessed his sins. The priest was supposed to be a positive character honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the morality of mercy. Miss Rand dropped him, she told me, when she found that it was impossible to make such a character convincing.&quot; 

The quotation from Rand's journals included a passage describing what John Galt represented to each main characters. That included the following: &quot;For Father Amadeus [Galt represents] the source of the conflict. The uneasy realisation that Galt is the end of his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man - and that his means do not fit this end (and that he is destroying this, his ideal, for the sake of those who are evil).&quot;(See [http://forum.objectivismonline.net/index.php?showtopic=5478])

Interestingly, Rand successfully did something similar in her very first book, &quot;[[We the Living]]&quot;. There, one of the main characters is a [[Communist]], Andrei Taganov, who definitely can be described, in a paraphrase of the above, as &quot;a positive character honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the ideology of Marxism&quot;. In other words, a very idealistic and dedicated Communist, who is totally devoted to the Party and is willing to lay down his life for Communism, yet is a sympathetic (and convincing) major character in a book which is as anti-Communist as can be. (Andrei is, moreover, the lover of the book's heroine Kira, which Rand explicitly described as representing herself in character though not in specific biographical details).

===Stacy Rearden===

Peikoff also mentions that as originally conceived the book was going to have a character named '''Stacy Rearden''', a sister of '''Hank Rearden'''. Not much is told of what her role was supposed to be and why she was eventually dropped. Apparently, she was going to be another parasite like Rearden's brother, mother and wife; presumably,  Rand came to the conclusion that three such characters around Rearden sufficiently fulfilled her literary and philosophical purposes.

'''Anthropology''' ({{IPA|/ˌænθɹəˈpɒlədʒi/}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}}, ''anthrōpos'', &quot;human&quot;; -λογία, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[Homo (genus)|humanity]].  Anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], and the  [[humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ethnography]] is both one of its primary methods and the text that is written as a result of the practice of anthropology and its elements. 

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, anthropology has been distinguished from other social science disciplines by its emphasis on in-depth examination of context, [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]] (socio-cultural anthropology is by nature a comparative discipline), and the importance it places on long-term, experiential immersion in the area of research, often known as [[Participant observation|participant-observation]]. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized [[Cultural relativism|cultural relativity]] and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas's arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]].

==Historical and institutional context==
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once described anthropology as &quot;the most scientific of the humanities and the most humanistic of the [[sciences]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric R.(1964) Anthropology. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebears, and the discipline has several sources; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], for example, claimed [[Montaigne]] and [[Rousseau]] as important influences. 

Ancient and medieval writers and scholars may be considered forerunners of anthropology, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of different peoples, including the Greek writer Herodotus, often called the &quot;father of history&quot; and the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient Celtic and Germanic peoples. A candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the 11th century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity]] and [[neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Akbar S. Ahmed (1984). &quot;Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist&quot;, ''RAIN'' '''60''', p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Walbridge (1998). &quot;Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam&quot;, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3), p. 389-403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). &quot;Islamic Anthropology&quot; and the &quot;Anthropology of Islam&quot;, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni's tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the [[Muslim world]] through to [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s work in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Ahmed/&gt;

Most scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a period when Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the 15th century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part. Developments in systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the &quot;culture concept,&quot; which is central to the discipline. 
[[Image:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of natural history, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the &quot;human primitives&quot; overseen by colonial administrations.  There was a tendency in late 18th century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved in accordance with certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.   

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most 19th-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past. As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the 19th century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism has been that many social science scholars (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focus disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuses disproportionately on the &quot;Other&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;; this has changed over the last part of the 20th century as anthropologists increasingly also study Western subjects, particularly variation across class, region, or ethnicity within Western societies, and other social scientists increasingly take a global view of their fields.

In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural and biological ''[[sciences]]'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''[[humanities]]'' generally study  local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''[[social sciences]]'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. In particular, social sciences often develop statistical descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. (2003) &quot;Anthropology, sociology, and other dubious disciplines.&quot; ''Current Anthropology'' 44:453-466.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology as it emerged among the colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) &quot;Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason,&quot; in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in the nationalist/nation-building enterprise. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of the nation through museums and other forms of public education.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large Asian region of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas; on the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist discourses of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, anthropology in the USSR and later the Soviet Bloc countries were highly shaped by the need to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed.

==Anthropology by country==
===Anthropology in Britain===
[[Image:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|E. B. Tylor, 19th-century British anthropologist.]]
[[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] ( 2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] ( 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Though Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading not fieldwork: Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists. Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of &quot;uniformity of mankind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) &quot;Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention,&quot; ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: &quot;independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race [sic] to another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as &quot;that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists. Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious feelings in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that &quot;religion&quot; has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism worldwide. 

Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a multidisciplinary expedition to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by Alfred Court Haddon and including a physician-anthropologist, [[W. H. R. Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description. 

A decade and a half later, Polish-born anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884-1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt; Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt; He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting &quot;the native's point of view&quot; through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to meet individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributors as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970]'' review: [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496(199702)24%3A1%3C211%3ATEMTRO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction.  However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for &quot;Social Anthropology&quot; by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.'' 

[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities. 

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it &quot;contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28199712%29102%3A5%3C1486%3AATBSA1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7] The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (Dec., 1997), pp. 1486-1488 doi:10.2307/2171126&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

===Anthropology in the United States===
====1800s to 1940s====
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies.

[[Image:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Boas, one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the &quot;Father of American Anthropology&quot;]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects.  The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].  [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818-1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]].  His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology.  Like other scholars  of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''.  Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;This would  be influential on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], who dedicated [[Das Kapital]] to Morgan.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boasian anthropology====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. Boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the U.S. government and wealthy patrons. It was rigorously empirical and skeptical of overgeneralizations and attempts to establish universal laws. Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little &quot;civilization&quot; they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible. In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, African Americans, and Native North Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today. The so-called &quot;Four Field Approach&quot; has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and prehistoric anthropology (i.e., archaeology). Anthropology in the U.S. continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[Image:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|Ruth Benedict in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up. Though such works as ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' and ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Anthropology in Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 1600s, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Domain of Canada.

True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910. Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Early scholars include the brilliant linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===Anthropology in France===
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|Émile Durkheim]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology. Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872-1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's [[Année Sociologique]] group; and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states. Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]]'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) &quot;A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self.,&quot; in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as “Une categorie de l’Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de ‘Moi’,” for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. In addition to the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities. 

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that &quot;primitive societies&quot; actively oppose the institution of the [[state]]. Therefore, these stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but took the active choice of conjuring the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups (&quot;international relations&quot;) but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.

The most important French social theorist since Foucault and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, however, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyles of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===Other countries===
Anthropology in [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]] is much influenced by British anthropology.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} In [[Greece]], there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of &quot;a science of the interior&quot;, although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science &quot;of the outside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, « L'anthropologie en Grèce », Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990) , [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005.

==Anthropology after World War II: Increasing dialog in Anglophone anthropology==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from each other that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]]. [[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] challenged standard neoclassical [[economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and also employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 80s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Lacan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S.

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became ''de rigueur'' as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50&lt;/ref&gt; Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including [[globalization]], [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], [[rights of indigenous peoples|indigenous rights]], [[virtual communities]], and the anthropology of [[industrial society|industrialized societies]].

==Approaches to anthropology==
===The &quot;four field&quot; approach===
Principally in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Sydel Silverman ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204(199202)33%3A1%3C1%3AI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X Introduction]'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 33, No. 1, Supplement: Inquiry and Debate in the Human Sciences: Contributions from Current Anthropology, 1960-1990 (Feb., 1992), pp. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology is often defined as being &quot;[[holism|holistic]]&quot; and based on a &quot;four-field&quot; approach. There is an ongoing dispute as to whether this makes sense theoretically or pragmatically in the structure of American academic institutions. Supporters&lt;ref&gt;Shore, Bradd (1999) ''Strange Fate of Holism.'' ''Anthropology News'' 40(9): 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; consider anthropology holistic in two senses: it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, linguistic, psychological, etc.); also many academic programs following this approach take a &quot;four-field&quot; approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]]. The definition of anthropology as [[holism|holistic]] and the &quot;four-field&quot; approach are disputed by some leading anthropologists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred_bundle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=[http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Edsegal/ Segal]  |first=Daniel A. |coauthors= [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/anthroCASA/people/faculty/yanagisako.html Sylvia J.

''World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations in Systems of Power''.  Pp. 69-85. Oxford: Berg Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; (''for more details see the section on the relations with the natural sciences and the Humanities'')

The four fields are:

*[[Biological anthropology|'''Biological''']] or '''physical anthropology''' seeks to understand the physical human being through the study of human [[evolution]] and [[adaptation|adaptability]], [[population genetics]], and [[primatology]].  Subfields or related fields include [[paleoanthropology]] (study of evolutionary history of the human species), [[anthropometrics]], [[forensic anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[nutritional anthropology]]. On the basis of [[Tinbergen's four questions]] a framework of reference or &quot;periodic table&quot; of all fields of anthropological research (including humanities) can be established. 
*'''Socio-cultural anthropology''' is the investigation, often through long term, intensive field studies (including participant-observation methods), of the culture and social organization of a particular people: language, economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, [[kinship]] and family structure, gender relations, childrearing and socialization, religion, mythology, symbolism, etc. (U.S. universities more often use the term [[cultural anthropology]]; British universities have tended to call the corresponding field [[social anthropology]], and for much of the 20th century emphasized the analysis of social organization more than cultural symbolism.) In some European countries, socio-cultural anthropology is known as [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783&lt;ref&gt;Han F. Vermeulen, &quot;The German Invention of ''Völkerkunde:'' Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740-1798.&quot; In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. ''The German Invention of Race.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; that is also used in English-speaking countries to denote the comparative aspect of socio-cultural anthropology.) Subfields and related fields include [[psychological anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[anthropology of media]] and [[anthropology of cyberspace|cyberspace]], and study of the [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] of social practices and cultural forms. 
*[[Linguistic anthropology|'''Linguistic anthropology''']] seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.  It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[anthropological linguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Archaeology|'''Archaeology''']] studies the contemporary distribution and form of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (materials modified by past human activities), with the intent of understanding distribution and movement of ancient populations, development of human social organization, and relationships among contemporary populations; it also contributes significantly to the work of population geneticists, historical linguists, and many historians. Archaeology involves a wide variety of field techniques (remote sensing, survey, geophysical studies, coring, excavation) and laboratory procedures (compositional analyses, dating studies ([[radiocarbon]], [[Optical dating|optically stimulated luminescence dating]]), measures of formal variability, examination of wear patterns, residue analyses, etc.). Archaeologists predominantly study materials produced by prehistoric groups but also includes modern, historical and ethnographic populations. Archaeology is usually regarded as a separate (but related) field outside North America, although closely related to the anthropological field of [[material culture]], which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as a means of understanding its cultural values. 

A number of subfields or modes of anthropology cut across these divisions. For example, [[medical anthropology]] is often considered a subfield of socio-cultural anthropology; however, many anthropologists who study medical topics also look at biological variation in populations or the interaction of culture and biology. They may also use linguistic analysis to understand communication around health and illness, or archaeological techniques to understand health and illness in historical or prehistorical populations. Similarly, [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] may use both techniques from both physical anthropology and archaeology, and may also practice as medical anthropologists. Environmental or [[ecological anthropology]], a growing subfield concerned with the relationships between humans and their environment, is another example that brings cultural and biological—and at times, archaeological—approaches together, as it can deal with a broad range of topics from [[environmentalism|environmentalist movements]] to [[wildlife conservation|wildlife]] or [[habitat conservation]] to traditional ecological knowledge and practices. [[Biocultural anthropology]] is a broad term used to describe syntheses of cultural and biological perspectives. [[Applied anthropology]] is perhaps better considered an emphasis than a subfield in the same sense as the standard four; applied anthropologists may work for government agencies, nongovernmental agencies, or private industry, using techniques from any of the subfields to address matters such as policy implementation, impact assessments, education, marketing research, or product development. 

More recently, anthropology programs at several prominent U.S. universities have begun dividing the field into two: one emphasizing the [[humanities]], [[critical theory]], and interpretive or semiotic approaches; the other emphasizing [[evolutionary theory]], quantitative methods, and explicit theory testing (over idiographic description),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-44.dir/issue-38.dir/38a05101.htm Shea, Christopher and Scott Heller (29 May 1998) &quot;Stanford Anthropology Department Will Split.&quot; ''Chronicle of Higher Education'']&lt;/ref&gt; though there have also been institutional pressures to rejoin at least one high-profile split department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2007/february14/anthsci-021407.html Trei, Lisa (14 Feb 2007) &quot;Anthropology departments instructed to form combined unit.&quot; ''Stanford Daily News'']&lt;/ref&gt; At some universities, biological anthropology and archaeology programs have also moved from departments of anthropology to departments of biology or other related fields. This has occasioned much discussion within the [[American Anthropological Association]], and it remains to be seen whether some form of the four-field organization will persist in North American universities.

As might be inferred from the above list of subfields, anthropology is a methodologically diverse discipline, incorporating both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. [[Ethnographies]]—intensive [[case studies]] based on field research—have historically had a central place in the literature of sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, but are increasingly supplemented by [[Multimethodology|mixed-methods approaches]]. Currently, technological advancements are spurring methodological innovation across anthropology's subfields.  [[Radiocarbon dating]], [[population genetics]], [[GPS]], and digital video- and audio-recording are just a few of the many technologies spurring new developments in anthropological research.

==Controversies about the history of anthropology==
Anthropologists, like other researchers (esp. historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism. &lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some commentators have contended:

*That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*That anthropologists typically have more power than the people they study and hence their knowledge-making is a form of theft in which the anthropologist gains something for him or herself at the expense of informants. 
*That ethnographic work was often ahistorical, writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; ([[Johannes Fabian]], ''Time and Its Other''). 

=== Anthropology and the military ===
Anthropologists’ involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]], and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists. But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces but others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies. 

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement and a great many resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA). In the decades since the Vietnam war the tone of cultural and social anthropology, at least, has been increasingly politicized, with the dominant liberal tone of earlier generations replaced with one more radical, a mix of, and varying degrees of, Marxist, feminist, anarchist, post-colonial, post-modern, Saidian, Foucauldian, identity-based, and more.&lt;ref&gt;D'Andrade, Roy (1995) &quot;Moral Models in Anthropology.&quot; ''Current Anthropology'' 36: 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA ) has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments … no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

However, anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are once again being used in warfare as part of the [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan]. The [[Christian Science Monitor]] reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], under the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] of [http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html ''Human Terrain Team'' (HTT)].

==Major discussions about anthropology==
===Focus on &quot;other cultures&quot;===&lt;!-- title wikilinked from  [[Urban anthropology]] --&gt;
Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-[[Western world|Western]] societies). For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz]] (1980) &quot;Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology&quot;, ISBN 0231083769, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot; /&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like [[History]] and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]'' Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521870690&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of existing contemporary society has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;*Marc Abélès, ''[http://www.jstor.org/view/08867356/ap020057/02a00050/3?frame=noframe How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field] ''[[Cultural Anthropology]]'' 1999 p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like [[Isac Chiva]] and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). The same approach of focusing on &quot;modern world&quot; topics by ''Terrain'', was also present in the British [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]] of the 1950s.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

It has been reported{{who}} that there has been an &quot;institutional and academic [[apartheid]]&quot; between the two sorts of anthropology, the one focusing on the &quot;Other&quot; and the one focusing on the &quot;Self&quot; contemporary society; an apartheid ranging from a &quot;no contact&quot; status to even open conflict. The countries where this was greater were Germany and Norway, but it was also significant in the 1980s France.

'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*[[Agriculture]] is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* [[traditional agricultural systems]], sometime termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which in may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil and the USA.

==Agricultural science: a local science==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.

==History of agricultural science==
{{main|History of agricultural science}}

Agricultural science began with [[Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as Avian Flu, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

{{Hermetism}}

Alchemy, a part of the [[Occult]] Tradition, is both a philosophy and a practice with an ultimately unknown aim, involving the improvement of the alchemist as well as the making of several substances described as possessing unusual properties. The practical aspect of alchemy generated the basics of inorganic chemistry, namely concerning procedures, equipment and the identification and use of many current substances.

Alchemy has been practiced in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Persia]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Korea]] and [[Chinese alchemy|China]], in [[Classical Antiquity|Classical]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim civilizations]], and then in [[Europe]] up to the 20th century—in a complex [[Social network|network]] of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.

==Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline==
[[Image:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Renel the Alchemist&quot;, by Sir William Douglas, 1853]]

Alchemy was known as the ''spagyric art'' after Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together''. Compare this with the primary dictum of Alchemy in Latin: &lt;small&gt;SOLVE ET COAGULA&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;— ''Separate, and Join Together''.

The best-known goals of the [[List of alchemists|alchemist]]s were the [[wiktionary:transmutation|transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] (called [[chrysopoeia]]) or [[silver]] (less well known is plant alchemy, or &quot;[[spagyric]]&quot;); the creation of a &quot;[[panacea (medicine)|panacea]],&quot; or the [[elixir of life]], a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely; and the discovery of a [[Alkahest|universal solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy Alchemy at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although these were not the only uses for the science, they were the ones most documented and well known. Starting with the [[Middle Ages]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic]] and European alchemists invested much effort on the search for the &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a legendary substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. The philosopher's stone was believed to mystically amplify the user's knowledge of alchemy so much that anything was attainable. Alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries, though not for their pursuit of those goals, nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature. Rather it came from their mundane contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, [[Tanning|leather tanning]], ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists).

Starting with the Middle Ages, some alchemists increasingly came to view metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy; and organic and inorganic chemical substances, physical states, and molecular material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states and ultimately, spiritual transformations. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]], which being at odds with the Medieval Christian Church was a necessity that could have otherwise lead them to the &quot;stake and rack&quot; of the Inquisition under charges of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blavatsky |first= H.P. |title= [[The Secret Doctrine]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Company |year= 1888 |isbn= 978-1557000026 |pages=vol ii, 238 |url=http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.

In his ''Alchemical Catechism'', [[Paracelsus]] clearly denotes that his usage of the metals was a symbol:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/tschoudy.htm |title=Alchemical Catechism |accessdate=2007-04-18 |author=Paracelsus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used  by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Hinkle, B. M. (1912). Psychology of the Unconscious : a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought. London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner. (revised in 1952 as Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works Vol.5 ISBN 0-691-01815-4)&lt;/ref&gt;. Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in [[post-modernism|post-modern]] contexts. {{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of [[individuation]]&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;. In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which [[Gnosticism]] survived its various purges into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Jaffe A. (1962). Memories, Dreams, Reflections. London: Collins. This is Jung's autobiography, recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, ISBN 0-679-72395-1&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a [[Yoga]] of the East. The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist. His interpretation of [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical texts]] in terms of his [[analytical psychology]] also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;C.-J. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;C.-J. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

=== Magnum opus ===

{{main|Magnum opus}}
''The Great Work''; mystic interpretation of its three stages:&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.e-scoala.ro/germana/mihai_stroe26.html Meyrink und das theomorphische Menschenbild]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nigredo(-putrefactio)'', blackening(-putrefaction): [[individuation]], purification, burnout of impurity; ''see also [[Suns_in_alchemy#Opus_Magnum|Suns in alchemy - Sol Niger]]
*''albedo'', whitening: spiritualisation, enlightenment
*''rubedo'', reddening: unification of man with god, unification of the limited with the unlimited.

Within the Magnum Opus, was the creation of the [[Sanctum Moleculae]], that is the 'Sacred Masses' that were derived from the [[Sacrum Particulae]], that is the 'Sacred Particles', needed to complete the process of achieving the Magnum Opus.

== Alchemy as a subject of historical research ==

The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]], and the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

=== History ===
{{main|Alchemy in history}}
The origins of Western alchemy are traceable back to [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Neumann, Erich]]. ''The origins and history of consciousness'', with a foreword by C.G. Jung. Translated from the German by R.F.C. Hull. New York : Pantheon Books, 1954. Confer p.255, footnote 76: &quot;''Since Alchemy actually originated in Egypt, it is not improbable that esoteric interpretations of the Osiris myth are among the foundations of the art ...''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] later theorized that there were only four [[classical elements]] (rather than that of today's 112 [[chemical element]]s); Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. The Greek philosophers, in order to prove their point, burned a log: The log was the earth, the flames burning it was fire, the smoke being released was air, and the smoldering soot at the bottom was bubbling water. Because of this, the belief that these four &quot;elements&quot; were at the heart of everything soon spread, only later being replaced in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Geber]]'s theory of seven elements, which was then replaced by the modern theory of chemical elements during the [[early modern period]].

[[Image:Alchemy-Digby-RareSecrets.png|thumb|right|Extract and symbol key from a 17th century book on alchemy. The symbols used have a [[Bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with symbols used in [[astrology]] at the time.]]

Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. Alchemy starts becoming much clearer in the 8th century with the works of the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemist]], [[Geber|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (known as &quot;Geber&quot; in Europe), who introduced a [[Scientific method|methodical]] and [[experiment]]al approach to scientific research based in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were mainly allegorical.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942-1943).  Repr.  By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67-68), Frankfurt. 2002:
{{quote|“To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir’s alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]].  One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us.  Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.”}}
{{quote|“The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen,  Tannery, Lagercrantz , von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail…}}
{{quote|The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging.  An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory:  even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.}}
{{quote|It is different with Jabir’s alchemy.  The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparatuses, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts.  The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the [[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]] and the [[Hope|`amal]].  In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented for example in the ''Book of Seventy''.”}}
([[cf.]] {{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=A Critical Reassessment of the Geber Problem: Part Three|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Geber/Geber%203.htm|accessdate=2008-08-09}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous alchemists include [[Wei Boyang]] in [[Chinese alchemy]]; [[Calid]] and [[Rhazes]] in [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemy]]; [[Nagarjuna]] in [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|Indian alchemy]]; and [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[pseudo-Geber]] in European alchemy; as well as the anonymous author of the ''[[Mutus Liber]]'', published in France in the late 17th century, and which was a 'wordless book' that claimed to be a guide to making the [[philosopher's stone]], using a series of 15 symbols and illustrations. The philosopher's stone was an object that was thought to be able to amplify ones power in alchemy, and, if possible, grant the user ageless immortality, unless he fell victim to burnings or drowning; the common belief was that fire and water were the two greater elements that were implemented into the creation of the stone.

In the case of the Chinese and European alchemists, there was a difference between the two. The European alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold, and, no matter how futile or toxic the element, would continue trying until it was royally outlawed later into the century. The Chinese, however, paid no heed to the philosopher's stone or transmutation of lead to gold; they focused more on medicine for the greater good. During Enlightenment, these &quot;elixirs&quot; were a strong cure for sicknesses, unless it was a test medicine. Most tests were generally fatal, but stabilized elixirs served great purposes. On the other hand, the Islamic alchemists were interested in alchemy for a variety of reasons, whether it was for the transmutation of metals or [[Takwin|artificial creation of life]], or for practical uses such as [[Islamic medicine]] or the [[Inventions in the Islamic world|chemical industries]].

A tentative outline is as follows:

#Egyptian alchemy [5000 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 400 BCE], beginning of alchemy
#[[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]] [1200 BCE&amp;nbsp;– Present]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] ([[Hindu]] sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy&quot; - Multhauf, Robert P. &amp; Gilbert, Robert Andrew (2008). ''Alchemy''. Encyclopædia Britannica (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;, related to [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|Indian metallurgy]]; [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|Nagarjuna]] was an important alchemist
#Greek alchemy [332 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 642 CE], studied at the [[Library of Alexandria]]

#[[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic chemistry]] [800&amp;nbsp;– Present], [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]] and [[Avicenna]] refute transmutation, [[Rhazes]] refutes four [[classical element]]s, and [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] discovers [[conservation of mass]]
#European alchemy [1300&amp;nbsp;– Present], Saint [[Albertus Magnus]] builds on Arabic alchemy
#European chemistry [1661&amp;nbsp;– Present], [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]] writes ''The Sceptical Chymist'', [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] writes ''Elements of Chemistry'', and [[John Dalton|Dalton]] publishes his ''Atomic Theory''

=== Etymology ===

Alchemy, generally, derives from the [[old French]] ''alkemie;'' from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-kimia:'' &quot;the art of transformation.&quot;  Some scholars believe the Arabs borrowed the word “kimia” from [[Greek language|Greek]]. Others, such as Mahdihassan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3064584&amp;dopt=Abstract Mahdihassan S. &quot;Alchemy, Chinese versus Greek, an etymological approach: a rejoinder&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; argue that its origins are [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Thus, an alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix &quot;-ry&quot; was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as &quot;chemistry&quot;.

[[Alchemy (Islam)|Islamic alchemy]] was a forerunner of modern scientific [[chemistry]]. Alchemists used many of the same laboratory tools that are used today. These tools were not usually sturdy or in good condition, especially during the medieval period of Europe. Many transmutation attempts failed when alchemists unwittingly made unstable chemicals. This was made worse by the unsafe conditions.

Up to the 16th century, alchemy was considered serious science in Europe; for instance, [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous. Other eminent alchemists of the [[Western world]] are [[Roger Bacon]], Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Thomas Browne]], and [[Parmigianino]]. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational [[materialism]].

In the first half of the nineteenth century, one established chemist, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], worked on concepts similar to the old alchemy, such as the [[Odic force]], but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.

Matter transmutation, the old goal of alchemy, enjoyed a moment in the sun in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert platinum atoms into gold atoms via a [[nuclear reaction]]. However, the new gold atoms, being unstable [[isotope]]s, lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart. More recently, reports of table-top element transmutation—by means of [[electrolysis]] or [[sonic cavitation]]—were the pivot of the [[cold fusion]] controversy of 1989. None of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated.

=== Alchemy in traditional medicine ===
{{Cleanup-section|date=October 2008}}
Traditional medicines involve transmutation by alchemy, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques.  In [[Chinese medicine]] the alchemical traditions of [[pao zhi]] will transform the nature of the temperature, taste, body part accessed or toxicity.  In [[Ayurveda]] the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are used to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity.  In the [[spagyric]] processing of [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] similar effects are found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneearthherbs.squarespace.com/safety-regulation/ Tillotson, Alan; AHG, D.Ay., PhD &quot;Safety and Regulation&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetherbs.com/articles/processing_chinese_herbs.htm Tierra, Michael; AHG, OMD, L.Ac. ''Processing Chinese Herbs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herbalist-alchemist.com/benefits.htm &quot;Benefits of Herbal Extracts&quot;; herbalist-alchemist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear transmutation ===
{{main|Nuclear transmutation}}

In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] used [[artificial disintegration]] to convert [[nitrogen]] into [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stmary.ws/physics/amsco_review_and_glencoe/chapter05.pdf|format=pdf |title= Reviewing Physics: The Physical Setting |author= Amsco School Publications |authorlink= http://worthyisthelamb.info/amsco/newtitles.html |format= |work= |publisher= Amsco School Publications |language= English |quote= &quot;The first artificial transmutation of one element to another was performed by Rutherford in 1919. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen with energetic alpha particles that were moving fast enough to overcome the electric repulsion between themselves and the target nuclei. The alpha particles collided with, and were absorbed by, the nitrogen nuclei, and protons were ejected. In the process oxygen and hydrogen nuclei were created.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, this sort of ''scientific transmutation'' is routinely performed in many [[nuclear physics]]-related laboratories and facilities, like [[particle accelerator]]s, [[nuclear power station]]s and [[nuclear weapons]] as a by-product of [[fission]] and other physical processes.

=== Synthesis of noble metals ===
{{main|Synthesis of noble metals}}

The synthesis of noble metals refers to the realization of the age-old dream of alchemists—to artificially produce [[noble metal]]s. The goal of this could be to achieve greater economic gain when compared to traditional methods of obtaining noble metals. Synthesis of noble metals is only possible with methods of [[nuclear physics]], either using [[nuclear reactor]]s or by [[particle accelerator]]s. Particle accelerators require huge amounts of [[energy]], while nuclear reactors produce energy, so only production methods utilizing a nuclear reactor are of economic interest.

=== In popular culture ===

The subject of alchemy is extensively used in many cartoons and comic books, often in the form of superpowers. In some Japanese anime and manga, most notably ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', alchemy and transmutation are treated as sciences, mixed with magic but fully understandable and utilizable with proper knowledge. ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' also refers to [[First Law of Thermodynamics|equivalency]] or equivalent exchange for alchemy to work; i.e to create, something of equal value must be lost, thus making something into something related or new. In ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', alchemy is used primarily as a means for superpowers.

=== In contemporary art ===
In the twentieth century alchemy was a profoundly important source of inspiration for the Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], who used the symbolism of alchemy to inform and guide his work. M.E. Warlick wrote his ''Max Ernst and Alchemy'' describing this relationship in detail.

Contemporary artists use alchemy as inspiring subject matter, like [[Odd Nerdrum]], whose interest has been noted by [[Richard Vine]], and the painter [[Michael Pearce]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callutheran.edu/schools/cas/programs/art/faculty/?profile_id=207 Cal Lutheran | Department of Art - Faculty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, whose interest in alchemy dominates his work. His works ''Fama'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.callutheran.edu/pearce/category/fama/ The Gilded Raven Blog + » fama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Aviator's Dream'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.callutheran.edu/pearce/category/storm-the-aviators-dream/ The Gilded Raven Blog + » Storm / The Aviator’s Dream&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly express alchemical ideas in a painted allegory.

Scotsman [[Adam MacLean]] has made the study and revitalization of alchemy his life, reproducing seminal texts in hand bound leather covered editions and making fine quality copies of important alchemical imagery.

'''Austria''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Austria.ogg|[ˈɔːstɹiə]}} ({{lang-de|Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Österreich.ogg|Österreich}}), officially the '''Republic of Austria''' ({{lang-de|Republik Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Republik Österreich.ogg|Republik Österreich}}), is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]].
It borders both [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the east, [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west. The [[capital]] is the city of [[Vienna]] on the [[Danube River]].&lt;ref&gt;CIA map 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory of Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first documented in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into the ''Österreich''.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 4&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria is a [[parliamentary government|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] comprising nine federal states&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 17&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of six European countries that have declared [[neutral country|permanent neutrality]]&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson neutral&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its [[constitution]]. Austria has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1955&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich 267&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[European Union]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;CIA par. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[German language|German]] name {{lang|de|''Österreich''}} is derived from [[Old High German|Old German]] {{lang|goh|''[[Ostarrîchi]]''}} &quot;Eastern Territory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meaningofname&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Gwillim  |last=Law |url=http://www.statoids.com/uat.html |title=States of Austria  |publisher=Statoids |date=[[2006-01-09]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was erroneously Latinized as &quot;{{lang|la|[[wikt:Austria|Austria]]}}&quot; (Latin ''auster'' &quot;south wind&quot;, metaphorically &quot;south&quot; thus ''austrālis'' &quot;southern&quot; and so on. There is no evidence for the region being called &quot;South&quot; anything in any other language). {{lang|de|''[[Reich]]''}} can also mean &quot;empire,&quot; and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]/[[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], although not in the context of the modern Republic of {{lang|de|''Österreich''}}. The term probably originates in a [[vernacular]] translation of the [[Medieval Latin]] name for the region: {{lang|la|''Marchia orientalis''}}, which translates as &quot;eastern marches&quot; or &quot;eastern borderland&quot;, as it was situated at the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that was also mirrored in the name ''[[Ostmark]]'', for a short period  applied after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Germany]].
However, [[Friedrich Heer]], one the most important Austrian historians in the 20th century, stated in his book ''Der Kampf um die österreichische Identität'' (The Struggle Over Austrian Identity), that the Germanic form ''ostarrîchi'' was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the [[Celtic languages]] of ancient Austria: More than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called ''Norig'' by the Celtic population ([[Hallstatt culture]]); ''No-'' or ''Nor-'' meant ''East'' or ''Eastern'', whereas ''Rig'' is the related to the modern German ''Reich''; realm (among other things). Accordingly, ''Norig'' would essentially mean ''ostarrîchi'' and ''Österreich'', thus ''Austria''. The Celtic name was eventually Latinized to ''noricum'', when the Romans conquered and Romanized the country that later became Austria. The name of ''Noricum'' was then used to designate the Roman province.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

The current official designation is the ''Republic of Austria'' ({{lang|de|Republik Österreich}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia government&quot;&gt;[[CIA]] § Government&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally known after the fall of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1918 as the ''Republic of [[German Austria]]'' ({{lang|de|Republik Deutschösterreich}}) , but the state was forced to change its name to &quot;Republic of [[Austria]]&quot; in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. The name was changed again during the [[Austro-fascist]] regime (1934–1938) , into ''Federal State of Austria'' ({{lang|de|Bundesstaat Österreich}}) , but restored after regaining independence and the birth of the Second Austrian Republic (1955 – present).

During the period of monarchy, Austria was known as the ''Austrian Empire'' ({{lang|de|Kaisertum Österreich}}) ; however no official designation existed since the empire was strongly multiethnic. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the empire became known as ''[[Austria-Hungary]]'' reflecting the [[dual monarchy]] character.&lt;!--

==History==
{{main|History of Austria}}
Settled in prehistoric times,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 17&quot; /&gt; the [[central Europe]]an land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by [[Bavarians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot;/&gt;. [[Charlemagne]] conquered the area in 788 encouraged colonization and introduced [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot;&gt;Johnson 19&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot;&gt;Johnson 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wappen röm.kaiser.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Coats of arms of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor]]

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996 where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot;/&gt; In 1156 the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs went extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot;&gt;Johnson 21&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Otakar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot;/&gt; His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolf I of Germany]] in 1278.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 23&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, from then on, every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the Hereditary Lands. In 1477, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Low Countries]] for the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 11&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married the heiress of [[Castile]] and [[Aragon]], and thus acquired [[Spain]] and its Italian, African, and New World appendages for the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot;/&gt; In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606.

During the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705) and following the successful defense of [[Battle of Vienna|Vienna]] in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; a series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699. [[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]] the [[German dualism|Austrian–Prussian dualism]] began in Germany.
Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).

[[Image:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|left|225px|''The Congress of Vienna'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], 1819.]]

Austria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]] - at the beginning highly  unsuccessful - with successive defeats at the hands of [[Napoleon]] meaning the end of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806. Two years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 34&lt;/ref&gt; in 1804, the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic wars]]. It thus emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of four of the continent's dominant powers. The same year, the [[German Confederation]], ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands where shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot;&gt;Johnson 36&lt;/ref&gt; A unified Germany [[Image:franzferdinand.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] (right) with his family.]] would have been possible either as a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the [[German Confederation]] without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]]  the crown of the new formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864 Austria and [[Prussia]] fought together against [[Denmark]], and successfully freed the independent duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies, they fought in 1866 the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot;/&gt; Austria had to leave the [[German Confederation]] and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 55&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze 233&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various [[Slav]] groups such as [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Czechoslovakia|Czechs]], [[Czechoslovakia|Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]], as well as large [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Romania]]n communities. As a result, ruling Austria-Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements.  Yet the central government tried its best to be accommodating in some respects;  minorities were entitled to schools in their own language, for example. The assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by [[Gavrilo Princip]] (a member of the Serbian nationalist group the [[Black Hand]])&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; was the immediate cause for the outbreak of World War I, leading to the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The Empire was broken up according to the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]) and the remaining subordinate territories became independent states. However, over 3 million  German Austrians found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic in the respective states of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 246&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1918 and 1919, Austria was officially known as the Republic of [[German Austria]] ({{lang|de|''Republik Deutschösterreich''}}). Not only did the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also forbade the name; it was therefore changed to the Republic of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 245&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchy was dissolved in 1919 and a parliamentary democracy was set up under the constitution of 10 November 1920.

[[Image:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|right|225px|Map of Austria-Hungary]]

In the autumn  of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 257-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilize the currency, and improve its general economic condition.  With the granting of the loan, Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. The [[First Austrian Republic]], lasted until 1933 when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] dissolved parliament and established an autocratic regime tending towards Italian fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 269-70&lt;/ref&gt;
The two big parties at this time — the Social Democrats and the Conservatives — had paramilitary armies, which fought each other&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 261&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] broke out.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot;&gt;Johnson 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1934, several members of the Schutzbund were executed,&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 283&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot;/&gt; In May of that year the Fascists introduced a new constitution (&quot;[[Maiverfassung]]&quot;) which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a [[Nazi]] coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 292&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], struggled to keep Austria independent, but on 12 March 1938 German troops occupied the country&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; and established a plebiscite confirming union with Germany. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] a native of Austria proclaimed the annexation (''[[Anschluss]]'') of Austria by Germany. Austria was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent state. The Nazis called Austria &quot;[[Ostmark]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot;/&gt; until 1942 when it was again renamed and called &quot;Alpen-Donau-Reichsgaue.&quot; Vienna fell on 13 April 1945 during the Soviet [[Vienna Offensive]] just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. [[Karl Renner]] astutely set up a Provisional Government in [[Vienna]] in April with the tacit approval of the victorious Soviet forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 135–6&lt;/ref&gt; and declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich.

Much like Germany, Austria, too, was divided into a British, a French, a Soviet and an American Zone and governed by the [[Allied Commission for Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 137&lt;/ref&gt; Largely owing to [[Karl Renner]]'s action on April 27th in setting up a Provisional Government, however, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot;/&gt; The Austrian Government was recognized and tolerated by the Four Powers. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies. On 15 May 1955 Austria regained full independence by concluding the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955 Austria was declared &quot;permanently neutral&quot; by act of Parliament, which it remains to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The political system of the Second Republic came to be characterized by the system of ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of some political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People's Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 139&lt;/ref&gt; Interest group representations with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, businesspeople, farmers etc.) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 165&lt;/ref&gt; The Proporz and consensus systems largely held even up to 1983.

The country became member of the [[European Union]] in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 447,449&lt;/ref&gt; and retained its constitutional neutrality, like some other EU members, such as Sweden. The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military neutrality: While the SPÖ supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians. Since the &quot;permanent neutrality&quot; forms part of the Austrian constitution, a two-thirds majority in the Austrian parliament would be needed for such a change in policy.

==Politics==
[[Image:Austria Parlament Athena.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Austrian Parliament in [[Vienna]]]]

{{main|Politics of Austria}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;

===Political system===
The [[Parliament of Austria]] is located in [[Vienna]], the nation's largest city and capital. Austria became a federal, [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentarian, democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. It was reintroduced in 1945 to the nine [[States of Austria|states]] of the Federal Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[head of state#Parliamentary system|head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]], who is directly elected by popular vote. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the president. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]].

The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat is determined every five years by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) is allowed to vote to fill its 183 seats. A recent extension of that term from four to five years will become effective after the next election. While there is a general threshold of 4 percent for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or {{lang|de|''Direktmandat''}}, in one of the 43 regional election districts. The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]] has a limited right of [[veto]] (the Nationalrat can — in almost all cases — ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. &quot;vote of persistence&quot;). A convention, called the {{lang|de|''Österreich -Konvent''}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konvent.gv.at/ Willkommen beim Österreich Konvent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was convened in June 30, 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform. However, some important parts of the final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented.

===Recent political developments===
In February 2000 the conservative People's Party formed a coalition with the controversial nationalistic Freedom Party, headed by [[Jörg Haider]]. The (at that time) 14 other member states of the [[European Union]] - but not the EU itself - condemned Austria's new coalition and froze diplomatic contacts. These measures were commonly referred to as &quot;sanctions&quot; although they were more or less just motions of diplomatic unfriendliness. Given the controversy, Haider chose not to join the government, but he continued to wield influence from the sidelines. This was not, however, the first time that the Republic of Austria had displeased international opinion. In 1986, the population voted for [[Kurt Waldheim]] as president despite his revelation that he had been active in the [[Wehrmacht]] as an intelligence officer during World War II.

In September 2002, the coalition between the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] and the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] dissolved after a shake-up in the Freedom Party. In November 2002, the People's Party made large gains in general elections again. After a lot of coalition talks with other parties, the People's Party again formed a government with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in February 2003 with [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] as Chancellor.

After general elections held in October 2006, the Social Democrats emerged as the largest party, whereas the People's Party lost about 8% in votes. Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and Social Democrats formed a [[Grand Coalition]] with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor.

===Foreign policy===
[[Image:Austrian embassy in London.JPG|150px|thumb|Embassy of Austria in [[London]]]]
{{main|Foreign relations of Austria}}
The 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognized Austria as an independent and sovereign state. In October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional law in which &quot;Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality.&quot; The second section of this law stated that &quot;in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory.&quot; Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality.

Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the Soviet Union, granting overflight rights for the [[United Nations|UN]]-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and, since 1995, contemplating participation in the [[European Union|EU's]] evolving security structure. Also in 1995, it joined the Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia.

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organizations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE).

===Energy politics===
In 1972, the country began construction of a [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] electricity-generation station at [[Zwentendorf]] on the River [[Danube]], following a unanimous vote in parliament.  However, in 1978, a [[referendum]] voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.

Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by [[hydropower]]. Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to nearly 80% of total use in Austria. The rest is produced by [[gas]] and [[oil]] powerplants.

==Military==
[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Guard Company on parade - July 14th 2007, [[Champs Elysées]], [[Paris]].]]
{{main|Military of Austria}}
The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (&quot;Bundesheer&quot;) mainly relies on [[conscription]]. All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit get recruited for a six months long [[military service]], which can be postponed under some circumstances. [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally possible and obliges to serve an institutionalized nine months [[Zivildienst|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte) , Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte) , International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) , and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte) ; next to Mission Support (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Command Support (Kommando Führungsunterstützung; KdoFüU). Being a [[landlocked country]], Austria has no [[navy]].

In 2004, Austria's defense expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.9% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 45,000 soldiers, of which about half are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] (currently [[Heinz Fischer]]) is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. In practical reality, however, command of the Austrian Armed Forces is almost exclusively exercised by the Minister of Defense, currently [[Norbert Darabos]].

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot; separating Austria and Hungary, the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by illegal immigrants. This assistance came to an end when Hungary joined the EU Schengen area in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing &quot;internal&quot; border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergencies, such as in the wake of natural disasters etc. They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its self-declared status of permanent neutrality, Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU) , in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (rescue dog handlers, etc) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]] and, since 1974, in the [[Golan Heights]].

==States==
{{main|States of Austria}}
As a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}). These states are then divided into [[district]]s ({{lang|de|''[[Bezirke]]''}}) and cities ({{lang|de|''[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]''}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|''Gemeinden''}}). Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government.

==Geography==
[[Image:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|left|240px|Topography of Austria]]
{{main|Geography of Austria}}
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country due to its location in the [[Alps]]. The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (84&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km² or 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq. mi]]) , only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 meters (1,640&amp;nbsp;ft). The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

[[Image:Schröcken2.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Austrian countryside of [[Schröcken]].]]
Austria can be divided into five areas. The biggest area are the [[Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]], which constitute 62% of Austria's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the [[Alps]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% of its area. The foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass, and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Central European mixed forests]], [[Pannonian mixed forests]], [[Alps conifer and mixed forests]] and [[Western European broadleaf forests]].

==Climate==
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the [[Alps]] the [[alpine climate]] is the predominant one. In the East, in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]], the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter, in the summer temperatures can be relatively warm reaching 20-35 degrees Celsius.

The six highest mountains in Austria are:

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Austria}}
{{seealso|List of Austrian companies}}
[[Image:T-mobil center wien.jpg|thumb|Modern Vienna]]
Austria is one of the 10 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, has a well-developed [[social market economy]], and a very high [[standard of living]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly-developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.

[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. But since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other [[European Union]] economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to EU aspiring economies. Growth in GDP accelerated in recent years and reached 3.3% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oenb.at/isaweb/report.do?&amp;lang=EN&amp;report=7.7 Real GDP Growth – Expenditure Side], provided by the Austrian National Bank {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Austria 100 Euro Vienna Philharmonic front.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#Vienna Philharmonic Coin|The €100 Vienna Philharmonic commemorative coin]] minted every year.]]
{{main|Austrian euro coins}}
{{main|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)}}

In Austria, the [[euro]] was introduced in 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin.  Eight different designs, one per face value, was selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of their coins.

Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004).  These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins.  Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Austria}}
Responsibility for educational oversight in Austria is entrusted partly to the Austrian [[states]] (Bundesländer), and partly to the federal government. Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years. School attendance is [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks Austria's education as the 18th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary education]] lasts for four years. Alongside [[Germany]], [[secondary education]] includes two main types of schools based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school: the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] for the more gifted children which normally leads to the [[Matura]] which is a requirement for access to universities and the [[Hauptschule]] which prepares pupils for vocational education but also for further education ([[HTL]] = institution of higher technical education; [[HAK]] = commercial academy; [[HBLA]] = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.), where you also get the [[Matura]]. 

The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as [[Medicine]]. Currently all EU students are charged a fee of about €370 per semester for all university studies. A recent [[OECD]] report criticized the Austrian education system for the low number of students attending universities and the overall low number of academics compared to other OECD countries.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A painting by [[Canaletto]] of [[Vienna]] during the first half of the eighteenth century.]]
{{main|Demographics of Austria}}
Austria's population estimate in October 2006 was 8,292,322. The population of the capital, [[Vienna]], exceeds 1.6 million (2.2 million with suburbs) , representing about a quarter of the country's population and is known for its vast cultural offerings and high standard of living.

In contrast to the capital, other cities do not exceed 1 million inhabitants: the second largest city [[Graz]] is home to 250,099 inhabitants, followed by [[Linz]] (188,968), [[Salzburg]] (150,000), and [[Innsbruck]] (117,346). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

German-speaking, by far the country's largest group, form roughly 90% of Austria's population. The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] are home to a significant indigenous [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene speaking minority]] with around 14,000 members (Austrian census; unofficial numbers of Slovene groups speak of up to 50,000). In the east-most Bundesland, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of the Hungarian half of [[Austria-Hungary]]) about 20,000 Austrian citizens speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and 30,000 speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Of the remaining [[number]] of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. So-called [[foreign worker|guest workers]] ''(Gastarbeiter) '' and their descendants, as well as refugees from [[Yugoslav wars]] and other conflicts, also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Since 1994 the [[Romani people|Roma]]-[[Sinti]] (gypsies) are an officially recognized ethnic minority in Austria.

According to [[census]] information published by Statistik Austria for the year 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_umgangssprache_staatsangehoerigkeit_und_geburtsland_022896.pdf {{lang|de|Statistik Austria, Die Bevölkerung nach Umgangssprache, Staatsangehörigkei und Geburtsland}}]|41.3&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, 124,392 speak German as their mother tongue (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland and [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen|Bolzano-Bozen]] (Italy).) The next largest populations of linguistic and ethnic groups are 240,863 foreign nationals from the former Yugoslavia (Serbian being the largest number of these at 135,376, followed by Croatian at 105,487); 123,417 Turkish nationals; 25,155 whose native tongue is English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 7,982 Arabs; 6,902 Slovenes (not including the autochthonous minority); 6,891 Slovaks; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The populations of the rest fall off sharply below 3,000.

The mother tongue of the population by prevalence, is German (88.6%) followed by Turkish (2.3%) , Serbian (2.2%) , Croatian (1.6%) , Hungarian (0.5%) and Bosnian (0.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[ftp://www.statistik.at/pub/neuerscheinungen/vzaustriaweb.pdf {{lang|de|Statistik Austria, Die Bevölkerung nach Umgangssprache, Staatsangehörigkei und Geburtsland}}, page 75. ]}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language, [[German language|German]], is spoken by almost all residents of the country. Austria's mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct German dialects. All of the dialects in the [[country]], however, belong to [[Austro-Bavarian]] groups of German dialects, with the exception of the dialect spoken in its western-most Bundesland, [[Vorarlberg]], which belongs to the group of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects. There is also a distinct grammatical standard for [[Austrian German]] with a few differences to the German spoken in Germany.

As of 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html Requirements to become an Austrian citizen], provided by the Viennese state government {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics concerning ethnic groups ({{lang|de|''Volksgruppenpolitik''}})===
An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (the [[Carinthian Slovenes]]) as well as [[Croats]] (around 30,000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm HKDC Geschichte - Frame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ({{lang|de|''Staatsvertrag''}}) of 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot;/&gt; The Slovenes in the Austrian state of [[Styria (state)|Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of July 27, 1955 states otherwise.

The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene- and Croat-Austrians live alongside the Germanic population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The current governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view. Another interesting phenomenon is the so called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windischen-Theorie&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This theory was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in Austria}}
[[Image:Tizian 066.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], ''also '''Charles I of Spain''', [[Austrian Habsburg]]'' &lt;br/&gt; ruler and one of the major figures of the [[Counter-Reformation]].]]

At the end of the twentieth century, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Census 2001: Population 2001 according to religious affiliation and nationality|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf|accessmonthday=December 17|accessyear=2007|language=German|publisher=Statistik Austria|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about 5% considered themselves [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; Both these numbers have been in decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicism, which has suffered an increasing number of seceders from the church.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Austrian Catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax (calculated by income —about 1%) to the Austrian Roman Catholic Church, which might (have) act(ed) as an incentive to leave the church.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

About 12% of the population declare that they have [[irreligion|no religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; Of the remaining people, around 340,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities, mainly due to the influx from [[Turkey]], furthermore [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; About 180,000 are members of [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, more than 20.000 are active [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/statistics/worldwide_report.htm Statistics: 2005 Report of Jehovah's Witnesses Worldwide].&lt;/ref&gt; and about 8,100 are [[Judaism|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;/&gt; The Austrian Jewish Community of 1938 – Vienna alone counted more than 200,000 - was reduced to solely 4,000 to 5,000 after the [[World War II|Second World War]], with approximately 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in [[the Holocaust]] and 130,000 emigrating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture/jewishvienna/history/nationalsocialism.html Expulsion, Deportation and Murder - History of the Jews in Vienna] Vienna Webservice&lt;/ref&gt; A significant proportions of the current Jewish population are post-war immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe and central Asia (including  [[Bukharian Jew]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjews.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=212 Bukharian Jews find homes on Long Island], ''Bukharian Reviews'', September 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism in Austria|Buddhism]], which was legally recognized as a religion in Austria in 1983 has a following of 20,000 (10,402 at the 2001 [[census]]).{{fact|date=December 2007}}

According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;EUROBAROMETER&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf
|title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 - page 11
|accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''54%''' of Austrian citizens responded that &lt;font color=&quot;#884400&quot;&gt;''&quot;they believe there is a God&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;.
* '''34%''' answered that &lt;font color=&quot;#884400&quot;&gt;''&quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;.
* '''8%''' answered that &lt;font color=&quot;#884400&quot;&gt;''&quot;they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;.

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Austria (and Bavaria) was the heart of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the absolute monarchy of [[Habsburg]] imposed a strict regime to maintain Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habsburg]]s viewed themselves as the vanguard of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and all other confessions and religions were repressed. In 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] issued a Patent of Tolerance that allowed other Christian confessions a limited [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]]. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right in the Austro-Hungarian ''[[Ausgleich]]'' in 1867 thus paying tribute to the fact that the monarchy was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian [[Orthodox Christians]] (Austria neighboured the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries) , and both [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]].

Austria continued to remain largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918, First Republic Catholic leaders such as [[Theodor Innitzer]] and [[Ignaz Seipel]] took leading positions within or close to Austria's government and increased their influence during the time of the [[Austrofascism]]; —Catholicism was treated much like a [[state religion]] by [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Although Catholic leaders initially welcomed the Germans{{fact|date=January 2008}} in 1938 during the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into [[Germany]], Austrian Catholicism stopped its support of [[Nazism]] later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the [[Third Reich]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, a stricter secularism was imposed in Austria, and religious influence on politics declined.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Culture==

{{Austrians}}

===Music===
{{main|Music of Austria}}
[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|140px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756-1791).]]
Austria's past as a European power and its cultural environment have generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria has been the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]], [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]].

Vienna has long been especially an important center of musical innovation. Eighteenth and nineteenth century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 1500s, and was focused around instruments including the lute. [[Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna.

Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.

Austria has also produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist [[Josef Zawinul]] who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right. [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was an internationally acclaimed [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] musician.

===Art and architecture===
{{seealso|List of Austrian artists and architects}}
[[Image:Upper belvedere.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture.]]

Among Austrian Artists and architects one can find painters [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]],  photographer [[Inge Morath]] or architect [[Otto Wagner]].

===Science, philosophy and economics===
{{seealso|Austrian School|List of Austrian scientists}}
[[Image:Sigmund Freud-loc.jpg|140px|thumb|left|[[Sigmund Freud]] in 1938]]
Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputations. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and quantum mechanics were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day quantum physicist is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].

In addition to physicists, Austria was the birthplace of two of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.

A focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in medieval times with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th century [[Vienna School|Vienna School of Medicine]]. Austria was home to psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]] and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].

The [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]].

Other noteworthy Austrian-born émigrés include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]] and the 38th Governor of California, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

===Literature===
{{seealso|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}
Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Adalbert Stifter]], and of writer [[Karl Kraus]].

Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are Nobel prize winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and writer [[Peter Handke]].

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of Austria}}
[[Image:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Wiener Schnitzel]].]]
Austria's cuisine is derived from the cuisine of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In addition to native regional traditions, it has been influenced above all by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Czech republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], [[Italy|Italian]] and Bavarian cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian Cuisine is therefore one of the most multi and transcultural cuisines in Europe.

Typical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], [[Schweinsbraten]], [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Knödel]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also Kasnockn, a macaroni dish with fresh Pinzgauer cheese and parsley, and Eierschwammerl ([[Cantharellus|chanterelle]]) dishes. The Eierschwammerl are the native yellow, tan mushrooms. These mushrooms are delicious, especially when in a thick Austrian soup, or on regular meals.

The candy [[PEZ]] was invented in Austria. Austria is also famous for its [[Apfelstrudel]].

===Sports===
[[Image:STANTON2.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Skiing slopes at [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]]]]
The most popular sport in Austria is [[alpine skiing]] and Austria shows constant dominance in the Nations-Cup. Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular.
The most popular team sport in Austria is [[Association football|football]]. However, Austria rarely has international success in this discipline, going out in the first round of the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] which was co-hosted with Switzerland. Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports including [[Austrian Hockey League|ice hockey]] and [[basketball]]. [[Bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] are also popular events with a permanent track located in [[Igls bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Igls]], which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]].

[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of Modern Astronomy.]]

Historically, [[astronomy]] was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws.  Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared.  Professional '''astronomers''' are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.  They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.  The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small.  The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 6500 members.  This number includes scientists from other fields, such as physics, geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.  The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,000 members from 87 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.

While the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small town, there is a huge community of amateur astronomers.  Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities.  The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.  Like any hobby, most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research.  However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

==Modern astronomers==
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger [[telescope]].  It is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time.  Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation.  Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes - most spend a few weeks per year observing, and the rest of their time reducing the data (changing it from raw data to processed images) and analyzing it.  Many astronomers work entirely from [[Astronomical surveys|astronomical survey]] or [[space observatory]] data.  Others work with [[radio telescopes]] like the [[Very Large Array]], which is entirely automated, although it is maintained by telescope operators.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometime [[planetarium]]s as a public service and to encourage interest in the field.

'''Amoeboids''' are [[unicellular]] lifeforms that mainly consist of [[contractile vacuoles]], a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and cytoplasm as their basic structure. They move and feed by means of temporary cytoplasmic projections, called [[pseudopod]]s (false feet). They have appeared in a number of different groups. Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance human [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens. Many [[protist]]s also exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle. The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

==Morphological categories==
Amoeboids may be divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods. Those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s are called actinopods, and forms where they are not are called rhizopods, further divided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae. There is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that do not fall into any of these categories.

* Lobose pseudopods
:Lobose pseudopods are blunt, and there may be one or several on a cell, which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm surrounding more granular endoplasm. Most, including ''Amoeba'' itself, move by the body mass flowing into an anterior pseudopod. The vast majority form a monophyletic group called the [[Amoebozoa]], which also includes most [[slime mold]]s. A second group, the [[Percolozoa]], includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and [[flagellate]] forms.

* Filose pseudopods
:Filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering. The vast majority of filose amoebae, including all those that produce shells, are placed within the [[Cercozoa]] together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms. The naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups, the [[vampyrellid]]s and [[nucleariid]]s. The latter appear to be close relatives of [[animal]]s and [[fungus|fungi]].

* Reticulose pseudopods
:Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net. They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells. There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the [[gymnophryid]]s, and their relationships are not certain.

* Actinopods
:Actinopods are divided into the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]]. The radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons, including central capsules that divide the cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant. The heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their axopods to capture small prey, and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements. Both groups appear to be [[polyphyletic]].

However, amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups, including various different lines of algae not listed above.

* Subphylum Sarcodina
:Sarcodina is a subphylum of the phylum [[Sarcomastigophora]], of unicellular life forms that move by cytoplasmic flow. Some species use cytoplasmic extensions called [[pseudopodia]] for locomotion or feeding. The subphylum includes such protozoa as the common [[amoeba]] and the [[Foraminifera]] and [[Radiolaria]]. Most members of the subphylum reproduce asexually through fission, although some reproduce sexually. Sarcodina is sometimes subdivided into two classes - [[Rhizopoda]] and [[Actinopoda]].

[[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|The 95 graphic ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126 (decimal)]]
'''American Standard Code for Information Interchange''' ('''ASCII'''), {{pronEng|ˈæski}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?ascii001.wav=ASCII Audio pronunciation for ASCII]. ''Merriam Webster''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[character encoding]] based on the [[English alphabet]]. ASCII codes represent [[character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s, [[telecommunication|communications]] equipment, and other devices that work with text. Most modern [[character encoding]]s—which support many more characters than did the original—have a historical basis in ASCII.

Historically, ASCII developed from [[telegraph|telegraphic codes]] and its first commercial use was as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services. Work on ASCII formally began October 6, 1960 with the first meeting of the ASA X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;&gt;Mary Brandel (July 6, 1999). [http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9907/06/1963.idg/index.html 1963: The Debut of ASCII]: ''[[CNN]]''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Standard Code for Information Interchange, ASA X3.4-1963, American Standards Association, June 17, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; a major revision in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;USA Standard Code for Information Interchange, USAS X3.4-1967, United States of America Standards Institute, July 7, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and the most recent update in 1986&lt;ref&gt;American National Standard for Information Systems -- Coded Character Sets -- 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII), ANSI X3.4-1986, American National Standards Institute, Inc., March 26, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters. Some ASCII features, including the &quot;ESCape sequence&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Bemer, &quot;A Proposal for Character Code Compatibility,&quot; Communications of the ACM, Vol. 3. No. 2, February, 1960, pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; were due to [[Robert Bemer]].

ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing, mostly obsolete [[control character]]s that affect how text is processed; 94 are printable characters (the [[space (punctuation)|space]] is not printable). The ASCII character encoding&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization (December 1, 1975). &quot;[http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/001.pdf The set of control characters for ISO 646]&quot;. ''Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Registry''. Alternate U.S. version: [http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/006.pdf]. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;—or a compatible extension—is used on nearly all common computers, especially [[personal computer]]s and [[workstation]]s.

==History==
[[Image:ASCII Code Chart-Quick ref card.jpg|thumb|308px|US ASCII 1967 Code Chart was structured with two columns of control characters, a column with special characters, a column with numbers, and four columns of letters]]
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group. The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. The encodings in use before ASCII included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include [[control characters]] compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] standard, [[Fieldata]] and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required.

The committee debated the possibility of a [[shift key]] function (like the [[Baudot code]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six [[bits]]. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. This allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 4. Mackenzie, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary coded decimal]]. However this would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, this also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for error checking if desired.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 5. Mackenzie, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; Machines with [[octet (computing)|octets]] as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to ''0''.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer A. Sawyer and Steven George Krantz (January 1, 1995). ''A Tex Primer for Scientists''. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-7159-7. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The code itself was structured so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 8,9. Mackenzie, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm]]s easy, so it became position 32.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 10. Mackenzie, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee decided it was important to support the [[upper case]] 64-character alphabets, and chose to structure ASCII so it could easily be reduced to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 14. Mackenzie, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options for lower case letters and other graphics open, the special and numeric codes were placed before the letters, and the letter 'A' was placed in position 65 to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 18. Mackenzie, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits 0–9 were placed so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 0011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters. Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, these corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses. The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in France, so the @ was placed in position 64 next to the letter A.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), end of message (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.66, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; It now seems obvious that these positions should have been assigned to the lower case alphabet, but there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters instead.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.435.&lt;/ref&gt; The indecision did not last long: in May 1963 the [[CCITT]] Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,&lt;ref&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13-15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted in October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 - Meeting of October 29-31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May, 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|curly bracket]] and vertical line characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.247-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).

The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (least significant bit first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.

ASCII itself first entered commercial use in 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s [[TWX]] (Teletype Wide-area eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[Baudot code]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the escape sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;/&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Bemer]] (n.d.).

&lt;!-- &quot;The endorsement of the Federal government, then the largest purchaser of computer equipment, was probably the single most important reason for the subsequent wide adoption of ASCII.&quot; – Martha M. Gray [http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf]. /* ?? */ --&gt;
On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. ''The American Presidency Project''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the [[English alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII only suited the needs of the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is strictly defined only by ANSI standard.

ASCII has been incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ASCII, a significant advantage.

Asteroid [[3568 ASCII]] is named after the character encoding.

==ASCII control characters==
{{main|Control character}}
ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to carry printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. Control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or white space are called non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2822 (April 2001). &quot;NO-WS-CTL&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this left was sometimes intentional (where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream) and sometimes more accidental (such as what &quot;delete&quot; means).

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[ASR-33 Teletype]] series, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage up through the 1980s, lower cost and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (DELete) became de-facto standards. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually faded out.

The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for &quot;transmit off&quot;) as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.

Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;. Since the original standard gave no detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was specifically useful for [[punched tape|paper tape]], because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. Tapes designed to be &quot;hand edited&quot; could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; and then replacements put into the empty space.

As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the &quot;rubout&quot; character was lost. DEC systems, for example, interpreted &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character before the cursor,&quot; and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used &quot;Backspace&quot; for that meaning and used &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character after the cursor&quot;. That latter interpretation is the most common today.

Many more of the control codes have taken on meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (code 27), for example, was originally intended to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually drifted. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of an [[ANSI escape code]]. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an &quot;out of band&quot; character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] text editors.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The clearest example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. On printing terminals there is no question that you terminate a line of text with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; and &quot;Linefeed&quot;. The first returns the printing carriage to the beginning of the line and the second advances to the next line without moving the carriage. However, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduced unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters, plain text files on Unix and Amiga systems use line feeds alone to separate lines. Similarly, older Macintosh systems, among others, use only carriage returns in plain text files. Various [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems used both characters to mark the end of a line, perhaps for compatibility with [[Teleprinter|teletypes]], and this de facto standard was copied in the [[CP/M]] operating system and then in [[MS-DOS]] and eventually [[Microsoft Windows]]. Transmission of text over the [[Internet]], for protocols as [[E-mail]] and the [[World Wide Web]], uses both characters.

The DEC operating systems, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file (also done for CP/M compatibility in some cases in MS-DOS, though MS-DOS has always recorded exact file-lengths). Text [[string (computer science)|strings]] ending with the [[null character]] are known as [[ASCIZ]] or [[C string]]s.

==ASCII printable characters==
Code 32, the [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. The &quot;space&quot; character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; Codes 33 to 126, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Seven-bit ASCII provided seven &quot;national&quot; characters and, if the combined hardware and software permit, can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters: in such a scenario a backspace can precede a [[grave accent]] (which the American and British standards, but only those standards, also call &quot;opening single quotation mark&quot;), a backtick, or a breath mark (inverted vel).
